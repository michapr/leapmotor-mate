#
# It was mapped as "chargeCompleted" with the note "validate on a real charge". Nobody had. Nine
# complete charges over sixteen days from a B10 REEV (beta #12, michapr) say it is the opposite:
#
#   flag → 1   cable just connected, current −2.0…−3.8 A, 85 to 915 minutes remaining, SoC 15-76 %
#   flag → 0   current back to 0.1 A, minutes at 5, and three times SoC exactly 90 % — his limit
#
# Nine out of nine, no exception. On this car 3736 is "a charge is running", and Mate was printing
# "Fully charged" for precisely the hours the car was filling.
#
# What stood here before was a tolerance: ignore the flag when the SoC is more than 15 points below
# the charge limit. That was fitted to the first report — the flag seen at 23 % with the limit at
# 90 % — and it did hide the lie at the start of every charge, which is why this looked like a rare
# leftover rather than an inversion. It could not hide it past 75 %, so the claim came back exactly
# when a charge was nearly done and a user was most likely to look. A tolerance is the wrong shape
# of fix for a signal read backwards.
#
# So on a REEV the flag is dropped. Mate says "plugged in", which is true in every frame of the
# bundle, instead of a completion it cannot establish. Deriving a real "finished" is the next step
# and needs one thing this data does not settle: a car plugged in and WAITING for a scheduled
# charge also sits at flag 0, so the inverse reading alone would announce a completion for a charge
# that never happened.
#
# BEVs are untouched. There is no BEV bundle carrying 3736, the flag may well be honest there, and
# it is working today — this is not the moment to change it blind.

# unsigned magnitudes. The poller resolves this properly (client._resolve_coord), but this
# module keeps its own copy of the parse for the after-a-command / Refresh-button write — and
# that copy read ONLY the unsigned pair. So a west-of-Greenwich car had its history stored
# correctly by the poller and then, on the very next Refresh, the NEWEST row filed at the
# mirrored longitude: Andreexylus' Lisbon B10 (-9.14) jumped to +9.14, i.e. the sea off
# Sardinia, which is what the Overview map shows. Everything east of Greenwich was unaffected,
# which is why it survived this long.
#
# The signed pair arrives in the very same dict get_fresh_signals() already returns, so it costs
# nothing to prefer it. When a poll omits it, re-apply the sign the poller persisted (#43) —
# the web is a separate process and can't see the poller's in-memory sign, but it can read the
# setting the poller writes. Unknown sign → magnitude as-is, i.e. exactly today's behaviour.

    It is shown only when it says something, and TWO conditions gate it.

    First, the data must have fallen behind THE ROW, not merely be old in absolute terms. The two
    ages usually move together — if Mate itself hasn't polled for nine minutes, then "9 min ago" and
    "data 9m old" are the same fact printed twice, which is the duplicate-number defect we've been

    Second, the last frame must have had the car DRIVING or CHARGING. A car asleep in a garage
    overnight legitimately has hours-old data, and announcing that every morning is the "light that

    Mate's efficiency figure deliberately goes blank on a trip where the range-extender ran: a
    SoC drop stops measuring how efficiently the battery drove you once the generator has been
    refilling the pack underneath. That is right for the question "how efficient was this", and
    it leaves the other question — "what did this cost me" — unanswered on exactly the long
    trips that cost the most. Two REEV owners arrived at that hole independently, from different
    cars, in the same week (@michapr, who proposed this, and @gm27271).

    Cost does not care where the electrons came from. Fuel burned is fuel you bought; the NET
    drop in the battery is grid energy you bought. Whatever the generator moved from the tank
    into the pack is already counted once, in the litres — so subtracting it from the battery
    side is not losing it, it is refusing to bill it twice. No trip is excluded.

    Verified against physics rather than argued: on one 541 km range-extender day in @gm27271's
    signal bundle, this SoC-based figure came to 11.5 kWh while integrating the pack's own volts
    × amps over the same day gave 11.7 — two independent methods, 2% apart. (The same bundle also
    shows why the cloud's own kWh cannot answer this: the generator put 44 kWh back into that
    pack over a week, and the cloud counts none of it.)

    reev_total_consumption above works out both sides from percentages: the pack's SoC drop
    against a nominal capacity, the tank's level against a nominal 50 litres. That is the right
    tool where nothing better exists — it needs no prices, no typing, and it works trip by trip.
    But on a lifetime total nothing better is not the situation Mate is in: every charge it
    recorded already carries its energy AND its cost, and every refuel the owner entered already
    carries litres off a receipt. Measured beats derived, and it beats it in three separate ways.

    It reads the AC side. _billed_kwh returns the wallbox's own kWh for a home charge, which is
    what the meter charged you; the SoC-derived figure is the DC energy that reached the battery,
    smaller by the 10-15% lost in conversion (see the answer to #134 — the gap is physics, not a
    bug). A cost card built on the DC side understates the bill, always in the same direction.

    It needs no assumption about the car. No nominal pack capacity, so battery ageing cannot
    skew it; no linear fuel float, so a tank that reads optimistically near the bottom cannot.

    It sees what never became a trip. Vampire drain, preconditioning, cabin heating on the
    driveway: electricity bought and paid for that appears in no trip's SoC delta.

    What it cannot do is the other's job. It measures PURCHASES over a period, not consumption
    over those kilometres — charge the car tonight and drive it next week and the two land in

    Three LFP-specific refinements keep the trend honest — two guard the *ends* of the SoC scale,
    where the flat LFP voltage curve makes the BMS SoC least reliable:
    - **Cold charges are shown but excluded** from the headline/trend. A cold LFP pack delivers
      less and its BMS SoC drifts, so a winter session reads low — that's temperature, not ageing.
      Charges whose min battery temp is below `temp_min_c` (Settings `soh_temp_min_c`, default 15°C)
      get `excluded: True` and don't feed the figure, but stay in `points` for the chart.
    - **Charges ending near 100% weigh most** (the *top* guard): the BMS recalibrates SoC near full,
      so their SoC delta — and therefore the estimate — is the most trustworthy.
    - **Charges STARTING below `min_start_soc` (default 15%) are shown but excluded** (the *bottom*
      guard). Near-empty, each 1% holds less energy than capacity/100, so the BMS over-reports the
      SoC rise → `energy / ΔSoC` under-estimates capacity and the point plunges as an isolated
      outlier (reported by riri19, #125). Same treatment as cold: on the chart, out of the figure.

    bubbles — same ~110 m grid (3-decimal rounding) as get_frequent_places, so a station

    cluster carries its most-common resolved name (set by charger_locator's OSM/OCM sweep)
    and its most recent sessions (for the map popup). `key` is "lat,lon" rounded to the SAME
    3 decimals used to bucket, so /charges?station=<key> re-selects the identical cluster.
    top_n mirrors get_frequent_places (15) so a driver with many charge spots doesn't get a
    marker — and a JSON blob — per stop. min_sessions does NOT: a place visited once isn't a
    "frequent place", but a station used once IS the interesting datum here (the charger you
    stopped at on a trip), and dropping singletons would leave a driver who charged at six
    different chargers on one holiday looking at an empty map. top_n alone bounds the payload;
    ties on `sessions` keep get_charges' recency order, so the cap takes the newest one-offs.

    Note: the 3-decimal grid, inherited from get_frequent_places, can round two GPS fixes
    ~2 m apart into different buckets and split one physical station into two markers with
    split totals — a real (not just cosmetic) split here, since totals are billed amounts.
    Deferred: a true proximity merge is more work than this fix warrants.

    HOME charges are excluded — a home wallbox isn't a "colonnina" and, being by far the most
