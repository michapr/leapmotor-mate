"""#191 (@riri19): a search result has to say WHICH DAY it was.

The Charges page has two modes. In the calendar the day is the heading above the cards, so the
card itself needs no date. A search result stands alone — he looked up a station by name, found
the session, and the card told him 16:38 → 16:42 and nothing more; the only way to learn the day
was to go back to the calendar.

The date is therefore set by the SEARCH route only, and the card prints it only when it's there.
That split is the thing worth protecting: put the date in the card unconditionally and the
calendar starts repeating its own heading under itself, once per charge.
