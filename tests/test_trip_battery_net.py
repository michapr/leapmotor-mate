"""beta #11 (@michapr, @gm27271): a trip that ends with MORE charge than it started had an empty
energy tile, and the number behind it was never stored.

The poller computes (start_soc − end_soc) × capacity at trip close and throws it away: it only
feeds kWh/100 km, which is withheld when the net is ≤ 0 and — decisively — whenever the
range-extender ran at all (beta #10, and rightly so: a SoC-derived consumption means nothing while
the pack is being refilled mid-drive). So the tile was not a suppressed value, it was nothing.

It is now derived on read from the stored SoC pair, so every trip already recorded has it without a
migration, and shown ONLY when the pack ended fuller — where the net is positive the consumption
figure beside it already says so, and two numbers under one word is its own defect.
