## [2.19.0] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **A trip's own map now marks where you charged at the end of it.** Same amber marker as the Map's stations, with a popup carrying the kWh, the cost and a link straight to the charge. What counts as "this trip's stop" is a time window — from this trip's end to the moment the car next moved — so no GPS guesswork is involved: the car cannot have charged anywhere else in between. Charges at your own wallbox are left out, or every drive home would earn a "charging stop" for parking in the driveway.
- **‹ › buttons on a trip, to step to the one before or after.** Chronological, through the same trips the Trips list shows: a merged trip has no page of its own, so the arrows skip past it to somewhere you can actually land. A trip with nothing on one side simply doesn't show that arrow.
- **The Map's station cap is adjustable from the map itself.** It has always drawn the 15 busiest spots; someone who charges in many one-off places could see an older single visit pushed out by newer ones. A small box on the legend row now sets it — 0 shows them all. Both features and the box come from **@hubcasale** (#195).

### Fixed
- A charge the car reported with **no GPS fix** is stored as latitude 0, longitude 0 — which is not the same as *missing*, and the new trip marker took it at face value: on the test data one landed **5 132 km** away, in the Gulf of Guinea, on a trip that never left Milan. It now uses the same guard the Map's station cluster has always used, where 0 counts as absent.
- The station-count box saves through a POST rather than a URL parameter. A page that writes a stored preference just by being loaded gets re-triggered by every bookmark, Back button and link prefetch that touches it — and on an install two people share, one person's link would change the other's map. The value is clamped too, like the marker-threshold setting next to it.

## [2.18.0] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **The Charges page now tells you what a kWh actually costs you.** A sixth card next to the totals: your spend divided by the energy you paid for, quoted to three decimals — the one number that turns "I spent 101 €" into something you can compare against a tariff, a public charger or a litre of petrol. Asked for by **@adoewa** in #187, and it turned out he was asking for something Mate could already work out but only showed one month at a time, on another page.
- The card says what it covers. A charge with no cost yet — one you haven't tagged, or of a type you haven't priced — still has kWh, so leaving it in the division would report a price lower than the one you pay. It is left out, and a line under the number says so: *"25 of 26 sessions"*. Without that line the page would show a total energy and a total spend that divide into a **different** number from the one printed beside them, and nothing to explain the gap.

### Fixed
- **The monthly Report's "Avg price" was under-reporting, sometimes badly.** It divided the month's spend by the month's *total* energy, unpriced charges included. On the test data a single untagged charge out of ten was enough to show **0.199 €/kWh** for a month whose real price was **0.250** — a fifth off, and plausible enough that nobody would question it. Both places now compute the average the same way, from one function, so they cannot drift apart.
- The Report also quoted that price with two decimals, which flattens 0.250 and 0.199 onto 0.25 and 0.20 — hiding both the error and the correction. Prices per kWh now keep three decimals, like the per-litre prices already did.

## [2.17.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **You can now type a charging station's name yourself.** Every station name in Mate comes from OpenStreetMap and Open Charge Map, and some real stations are in neither: a company car park or any charger behind a barrier is invisible to both **by design**, so the 🔄 lookup could only ever come back empty on them — exactly **@adoewa**'s case in #193. A **✏️** button next to the lookup opens a small field: type the name, press ✓, done. It opens pre-filled with the current name, so it doubles as a quick correction; an empty submission changes nothing; and a typed name takes the charge out of the background lookup queue exactly like a found one would. One thing worth knowing: 🔄 still re-runs the database lookup and replaces the name when it finds exactly one match — press it only when a re-lookup is what you want. Written overnight by **@hubcasale** (#194), on top of yesterday evening's release, with all six languages covered.

## [2.16.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **The Scheduling page now says what your car is actually doing, before the form that changes it.** Both cards open with a line in plain words — *"Charges every day from 00:50 to 12:00, up to 100%"*, *"Quick cool once only at 07:00, 18°C"* — built from the car's own answer, with no extra call. **@riri19** selected all seven days of his charge schedule, saw the chips empty again after a reload and reported the schedule as lost (#190). Nothing was lost: on that card **no day selected means every day**, which is also the state every car leaves the factory in, so the row is empty for almost everyone. The chips still work the way they did — you pick the days you want rather than deselecting six of seven — but now the card says what the empty row means.
- The same line on the **climate** card, where it was needed more: an empty day row there means the **opposite** — one time only, not every day. Two cards, one under the other, identical rows of chips, opposite meanings, and nothing on screen to tell them apart. It also spells out the mode ("Quick cool" rather than a payload), the time and the temperature, and says plainly when nothing is scheduled at all.
- **A charge found by search now shows its date.** In the calendar the day is the heading above the cards; a search result stands alone, and it showed only "16:38 → 16:42". **@riri19** looked up a station by name and had to go back to the calendar to find out which day it was (#191). Same date format the history uses. Unchanged in the calendar, which already says it once.

### Changed
- The litres on a detected refuel now say they are yours to overwrite: *"gauge estimate — replace it with the litres on your receipt"*. The box was always editable, and the amber "≈ 35.15 L" above it reads like a figure the car produced, so people leave it. **@gm27271** worked out the consequence before hitting it: confirm 9 litres against a 10-litre receipt and the price per litre comes out 20/9 rather than the 2.00 actually paid — and that price weights the blend behind every trip that burns from that tankful. Range-extender research builds only.

## [2.15.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **A charge you typed in can now be corrected — all of it.** Until now, once a past charge was in, the only things you could still change were its note, its AC/DC tag and its cost; the times and the battery levels were fixed for good. **@adoewa** entered his entire charging history from a spreadsheet and then found no way to fix any of it (#188). Every charge you entered by hand — through the form or the CSV import — now carries an **✏️ Edit** button holding the start, an optional end, the energy, the cost, AC/DC and the two SoC readings, filled in with whatever is already there. Give it an end time and the session gets its duration back too.
- The button is on charges **you** typed and on no others. What the car measured stays as the car measured it: those numbers are readings, and a form over them would let one keystroke overwrite what actually happened. Mate now marks a charge as hand-entered when it is created, and the existing ones are recognised on update — the "Manual" tag on the badge could never do that job, because it also means *"I'll type the price myself"*, which people rightly use on real charges.

### Fixed
- **A charge with no battery reading no longer shows one.** A typed-in charge carries no SoC — the form has never asked for it — and the card was drawing that absence as a measured **0.0% → 0.0%**, with a yellow **+0.0%** beside it and an empty bar underneath. The figures were not wrong so much as invented, sitting next to real ones. Unknown now reads as a dash, and only a genuine zero still prints as 0.0%.
- **Changing your time zone can no longer move a charge the car recorded.** Since v2.12.1 Mate re-anchors hand-entered charges when you pick a different zone — correctly, because a time you typed is a time on your clock. It found them by their "Manual" tag, and that tag has a second meaning: it is also what you pick to type the price of a **real** charge Mate can't tariff by itself, which is a perfectly ordinary thing to do on a public charging session. Such a charge was therefore in scope, and while the first pass left it alone, a later change of zone shifted it by the whole offset — a session the car timed at 07:54 came back at 13:54 after a move between two continents. Found while building the edit form above, which needed to tell the two meanings apart anyway; the repair now asks the same, narrower question. Nothing you typed is affected, and no charge moves on update.

## [2.14.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **Litres now come from the car instead of from an assumption — and the assumption was wrong on the C10.** Every figure Mate has ever shown in litres was the fuel gauge's percentage multiplied by a tank size taken from a spec sheet: 50 L, the same for every range-extender. **@gm27271** decoded the signal that carries the litres the car counts for itself, and it measures the tank as a side effect — **47.5 L on a C10, 50 L on a B10**. So a C10 owner has been reading litres **5 % too large** all along: the fuel burned on each trip, the L/100 km, the level in the tank, the weights behind the blended price per litre, and the litres of a refuel Mate spots by itself. From now on the car does the counting wherever it reports it, and the per-model size is only the fallback for trips recorded before this update. He also showed why it is worth having: his own fill measured **34.416 L** where the pump ticket said 33.84.
- **Exporting your trips to CSV works again if you have ever merged two of them.** The button returned a page whose whole content was the words *Internal Server Error* instead of a file — not now and then, but on every attempt, for anyone with a single merged trip anywhere in their history. A merged trip carries one extra internal field that an ordinary trip doesn't, and the exporter took its column list from the first trip alone, so it fell over the moment it reached a merged one further down. Found and fixed by **@hubcasale** (#184), who traced it from the downloaded file's own contents; the columns are now the union of every row's, and internal bookkeeping fields are left out rather than printed as raw Python. Neither CSV export had a single test before this — they have six now.
- **A car model Mate hasn't met before can still read its own data.** Of every call Mate makes, exactly one carries the model in its address — the one that reads the car's live status — and the list of models that need a different address than their own name has two entries in it. Anything else asks for an address the Leapmotor servers don't answer, and the result is the most confusing failure there is: the login works, the car is there with the right VIN, the right model and the whole list of things it can do, the official app on the same account shows live data — and Mate shows nothing, from the first minute, for ever. **@arnolds77** spent two days on it with a B05, changing accounts and permissions that were never the problem. Mate now tries the family address once when a model's own one is refused, and remembers the answer — one extra call, once, on an install that was getting nothing anyway. Cars that already work are untouched and never make the extra call.
- **Restarting Mate while your car is stuck no longer records one frozen reading as if it were live.** When a car's telematics goes quiet the cloud does not say so — it hands back the last frame it received, over and over — and Mate has recognised that since v2.5.16 and refuses to store the repeats. But the marker it compares against lives in memory, so the first reading after any restart could never be seen as a repeat. **@riri19**'s B10 had been parked for two hours with its telematics silent, the cloud replaying a frame from 17:16; his Mate restarted at 18:51:03, and 18:51:05 went into his database as a fresh reading at 116 km/h. Mate now reads that marker back from disk on startup, the same way it already did for the battery level and the odometer.
- **Choosing ECO or Custom as your default drive mode now actually tags your trips.** Both were added to the list two releases ago, but only to the half of Mate that draws the Settings page — the half that stamps the tag on a new trip kept its own older copy of the list and threw anything outside it away. So the setting saved, came back selected, and quietly did nothing: every screen agreed with you and the trips came out untagged. Reported by **@adoewa**, who picked ECO the day it appeared. The three modes that already worked are unaffected, and trips you have tagged by hand were never involved.
- The two lists are now checked against each other, because that is the fault here: not a wrong value, a second copy nobody updated. A test that had used "eco" as its example of *an invalid mode* was still passing — it was asserting the bug.

### Changed
- Beta bundles now carry the full reply from the cloud's mileage/energy endpoint, not the two figures Mate reads from it. On a range-extender the lifetime average is electricity divided by a distance partly driven on petrol — **@michapr**'s car reports 12.6 kWh/100 km over its electric kilometres where Mate reports 8.9 over all of them, and **@gm27271** described the same thing from the other side. The split that would settle it is in none of the endpoints we had ever captured; if it exists it is in a field that call currently discards. Range-extender research builds only.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Mate now spots your refuels by itself.** A tank can only rise one way — nothing recuperates into it, nothing refills it while you drive — so when the car's own gauge goes up and stays up, somebody put fuel in. Each rise turns into a card on the Rifornimenti page carrying **when** and **how much**, and leaves you the one thing the cloud will never know: what you paid. Confirm it and it becomes an ordinary refuel; say it wasn't one and it never comes back. Asked for by **@gm27271**, in almost exactly this shape — *"there will be no data entered, this can be added later by the user"*. Range-extender cars only.
- It reads the history rather than watching from now on, so **the refuels from before this update are already there** the first time you open the page. What it claims is bounded by what a fuel gauge can tell you, and the card says so rather than pretending: the instant is an **interval** — after the last reading at the old level, by the first at the new one, which on a car that fell asleep at the pump can be the whole night — and the litres are an **estimate** off a float sensor, ~1 L being the smallest rise it will act on. Both are yours to correct before confirming.
- Confirming beats retyping for a reason beyond convenience: the refuel is filed **at the moment it happened**, with the exact tank level measured just before it. Typed by hand hours later, that residual is whatever the tank held when you got round to it — and it is what weights the blended price per litre.

## [2.13.3] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **The Overview now tells you when what you're looking at isn't current.** "Last seen" is the age of Mate's last poll, and the cloud always answers — so when your car drops out of coverage it keeps handing back the last frame it received, and the screen says "13s ago" over a position and a battery reading from half an hour before. **@riri19** described that trap precisely. Mate has always known the car's own timestamp on each frame; it just never stored it. It does now, and when the data has fallen behind, the line grows a tail: *Last seen 13s ago · data 33m old*. It is deliberately quiet the rest of the time — it appears only when the car was **driving or charging** (a car asleep in a garage legitimately has hours-old data, and saying so every morning would be noise), and only when the data is genuinely behind Mate's own polling rather than both being old for the same reason.

### Fixed
- **"Last seen" now speaks your language.** It was English on every install — *13s ago* under an Italian, German, French, Polish or Portuguese label — on the Overview card and in the map popup. It had been standing alone long enough that nobody noticed; putting a translated phrase beside it made it obvious.

## [2.13.2] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **The car's picture no longer hammers your Leapmotor account when it can't be downloaded.** Mate keeps the image package on disk and serves it from there — but that short-circuit can only save a request once the download has succeeded at least once. On an install where it never had, every single refresh of the Overview went back to the cloud: two attempts, each resetting the session, every 30 seconds, for as long as the page stayed open. From the cloud's side that is a login storm, and it answers a login storm by refusing — **@arnolds77**'s log carried 42 session resets and 35 refusals in 45 minutes while he was trying to work out why his car had no data. Mate now tries once and waits before trying again; pressing refresh on the image still goes straight to the cloud, because that's you asking. The once-per-restart re-download that picks up a repainted car is unchanged. The picture is decoration — it had no business spending the session everything else depends on.

## [2.13.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **The correction v2.12.1 made to hand-entered charges now waits until you've chosen your time zone — and follows you if you change it.** Yesterday's fix converted those charges using whichever zone was configured the first time Mate started after the update. Installing first and picking your zone afterwards is the ordinary order of events, so an install could be converted as though it were on UTC and then consider the matter closed: **@ghuaywen-ai**'s charges were still eight hours out while Mate believed it had corrected them. Nothing is converted now until a zone has actually been chosen, and the zone used is remembered — set or change it later and the charges that pass converted are re-anchored to it, giving back the times you originally typed. Charges you entered *after* the conversion are deliberately left alone: moving to another country doesn't change when you plugged in.
- If you updated to v2.12.1 without ever choosing a time zone, that conversion can't be undone automatically — v2.12.1 didn't record what it assumed. Choose your zone and any charge still shifted can be corrected by deleting it and importing your original file again, which now anchors correctly.

### Added
- **A month calendar for refuels, the same one the Charges page has.** Days you filled up carry their litres and how many stops, the month line totals litres and cost, and opening a day lists each refuel with its time, price per litre and the tank level before it. Asked for by **@gm27271** and seconded by **@michapr**; range-extender cars only, like the rest of the fuel section.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Your car's charge window, on the Overview.** Mate has known it for a long time, but only inside the Scheduling page — so at the one moment it answers a question, it wasn't there: cable plugged in, nothing happening, and no hint that charging simply starts at 22:05. It now shows as a chip under the car whenever the cable is in and nothing is flowing, which is exactly when you'd wonder. It never appears while the car is actually charging. From **@rop12770**, who sent the official app's own banner. The window is read from the car every half hour and cached, so the page that redraws itself every 30 seconds never costs you a request; changing it from Mate — the Scheduling page or a Home Assistant automation — updates the chip immediately.
- **Two more drive modes to tag a trip with: ECO and Custom.** The Leapmotor cloud never reports which mode you drove in, so this is a label you attach by hand — and the three Mate offered didn't match any real car. **@adoewa** photographed his C10's own screen: ECO · Comfort · Sport · Custom, with no "normal" at all, while **@gm27271**'s range-extender shows Sport · Normal · Individual. One list now covers both, and every trip you have already tagged keeps its tag.

### Fixed
- **The day you open in the Trips calendar shows its own totals again.** Distance, ♻️ regen, cost and a distance-weighted efficiency — the same four the old year/month/day list carried on every level, and which quietly went missing when the calendar replaced it. **@ghuaywen-ai** noticed the regen figure was gone; it had been, since v2.9.0. The cost now closes the line, lining up with the month total right above it. Regen stays hidden on a range-extender, where a battery being refilled mid-drive can't be told apart from braking.

## [2.12.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- **Charges you enter by hand are no longer pushed forward by your time zone.** A time you type is a time on *your* clock, but it was being stored with no zone attached — and everything Mate stores is UTC, so the page read it back as though you had typed a UTC time and added your offset on top. **@ghuaywen-ai** imported 150+ charges and found every one of them seven hours late. This was never only about the CSV: the *Add a charge* form on the Charges page did the same thing, quietly, for everyone outside UTC since the feature shipped. **Charges already in your database are corrected on the first start after updating** — each one with the offset that was in force on *its own* date, so a January charge and a July one are not moved by the same amount. If you had been compensating by hand, those entries will now show the time you actually meant, which may be an hour or two from where you left them.
- **The charges file Mate exports can now be imported back into Mate.** The export is a full dump of what the database holds, so its first column is an internal id — and the importer, which read columns by position, tried to read that word as a date and rejected the file on its first line, then on every row after it. **@adoewa** hit exactly that after exporting his charges to keep them safe across an update. The importer now reads the header and matches columns by **name**, so it accepts both the template we hand out and Mate's own export; columns it doesn't recognise are ignored. Nothing was taken out of the export — it still carries the location, power and duration for anyone who opens it in a spreadsheet.
- **A range-extender's cable code no longer looks like charging.** The cable reports a value while the car is *driving* that is not a connection at all. One of the two readers of that signal already knew to ignore it; the other didn't, and could open an empty charge session at the moment a stale speed reading lined up with it. Nothing was ever recorded — the empty session was discarded — but the two now agree. Found while going through **@ebagnoli**'s captures. Range-extender cars only.
- **And the same signal's "still connected" state now means the same thing on both sides of Mate.** The poller has counted it since v2.8.4, when reading it as *unplugged* was shredding slow AC charges into fragments; the web half never got that change.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Range-extender cars: what the driving actually cost, on every trip.** Mate leaves the efficiency figure blank when the generator has been running — a battery that is being refilled underneath you stops measuring how efficiently it drove you — and that left the long trips, the expensive ones, with no number at all. Statistics now carries **From the car's own gauges**: what left the battery beside the litres burned, across every trip, generator ones included. Proposed by **@michapr**, who also ran into it from a different direction than **@gm27271** did in the same week. Range-extender cars only; nothing changes for anyone else.
- **And beside it, what you actually bought.** The first card works both sides out from percentages. The second one doesn't have to: it adds up the charges Mate recorded and the refuels you entered, reads the electricity **at the meter** rather than at the battery, and shows the money. The two are not the same question and are not meant to agree — one is what came out over those kilometres, the other is what you paid for in that period.

### Fixed
- **The two buttons over the idle-drain chart no longer use the same word for different things.** One pair chooses how the value is expressed — a rate per 24 hours, or the battery actually lost. The other chooses how the bars are grouped — one per park, or one per calendar date. While both said "day" it looked like the second pair changed the calculation. It doesn't, and the rate everyone expects is already on by default. **@riri19** asked twice in one week and was right twice; the second button now says *per date*, in every language.
- **Charge detection: the setting now says what it measures.** "Minimum charging current" reads like the socket's rating, when it means what the car is drawing at that moment — and a domestic 230 V socket only ever delivers around 3–4 A, so a threshold nudged above that quietly loses every slow charge. The default was already right at 2 A; only the sentence was misleading. Reported by **@michapr**.

## [2.11.1] — 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **The calendar now shows which day you are looking at.** Picking a day filled the list below it, but the highlight stayed on today — so the page told you one thing and showed you another. The day you chose is now ringed, and today keeps its own amber number: when they are the same day you see both. Trips, Charges and Wallbox — all three calendars had it.
- **And it survives a refresh.** These pages reload themselves every half minute when left alone, and that reload used to take the day with it: ring gone, list gone, back to nothing selected. Your choice now comes back with the page, list included, the same way your place on the page already did. Following a link to one particular trip or charge also lands with its day ringed, which it did not before.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Compare the same journey across different days.** A 🔎 button on any trip with a GPS track lists every *other* trip that took the **same road** — not merely one that started and ended nearby — so the commute you drive twice a day finally becomes one series you can read: efficiency against outside temperature, against traffic, against the time of year. Each row carries its own overlap figure, so you can see how confident the match is. From **@hubcasale** (#174), answering a request from **@riri19**.
- Matching happens in two stages, both pure local arithmetic on coordinates already stored — no network call, nothing sent anywhere. A ~150 m cell on the start and end narrows the field; then the actual recorded path of each candidate is resampled every 100 m and compared with the trip you are looking at, and only a ≥70 % overlap counts. That second stage is the one that matters: endpoints alone would happily match a day you took a completely different road. The return leg is deliberately a separate group, because uphill and downhill are not the same drive.

### Fixed
- **The comparator no longer holds up the rest of the interface while it runs.** Its cost grows with how long you have owned the car — it re-walks the GPS track of every candidate — and it ran on the thread that serves every other page, so on a long history the whole app would sit still for a second or more. It now runs off to one side.
- **A trip whose first GPS fix never arrived is no longer filed under the wrong place on Earth.** When the car reports no usable position, Mate stores a zero rather than nothing, and the new route index treated that as a real location off the coast of Africa — which also meant such a trip could never match its own siblings on the commute it actually belonged to. It is now left unindexed, exactly as a freshly recorded trip already was.

## [2.10.2] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Trips and charges can write their own note — address, time and temperature.** A 🧭 button on any trip or charge builds a one-line summary and puts it straight into the note field: for a trip, the reverse-geocoded start and end address with the outside temperature already collected for it; for a charge, the station's address (the same lookup the 📍 label runs, skipped for home charges) with the times and the car's own outside and battery temperatures at each end. New trips and charges get it **by themselves** the moment they close — but only into an empty note, so anything you have typed is never touched. The button always overwrites, and asks first when there is something to lose. From **@hubcasale** (#171).
- **A switch to stop that happening by itself** — Settings ▸ Geocoder. Writing the note means looking an address up online, and a trip's two ends are, for most people, home and work; that should be a choice rather than a footnote. It ships **on**, and turning it off leaves the 🧭 button exactly where it is: the note stays one tap away, it just stops happening unasked.

### Fixed
- **The setup wizard showed the word "undefined" in French and German**, where the warning to use a Leapmotor account dedicated to Mate belongs — the single most important line of the whole setup, and the cause of the most common problem people report. The wizard keeps its own set of strings, separate from the rest of the app, and that one had never been translated; JavaScript renders a missing string as the literal text "undefined". Anyone setting Mate up in those two languages simply never saw the warning.
- **German and Polish were missing 80 and 91 strings**, so parts of the app appeared in English. All six languages now carry all 1027. Nothing was checking any of this, which is why both faults survived: **it is now checked** — every language must match English in both directions, every wizard language must match too, and the accepted-language list in the code must agree with the files on disk.
- **Range-extenders no longer announce "Fully charged" while the car is filling.** Signal 3736 was mapped as "charge completed"; nine complete charges from a B10 REEV show it turns **on** when a charge starts — cable in, current flowing, hours remaining — and off when it ends. On a REEV it means "a charge is running", so Mate now says "plugged in" rather than repeating a completion it cannot establish. What replaced it was a tolerance fitted to the first report, which hid the fault early in a charge and let it through near the end — where it was most likely to be seen. Fully-electric cars are untouched. Found from **@michapr**'s diagnostic bundles (beta #12).

## [2.10.1] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Removing Mate, from inside Mate — desktop app on macOS.** macOS has no uninstaller: dragging an app to the Bin takes the app and leaves everything it ever wrote behind, in a Library folder most people never open. Settings → App now has a button that does the whole thing — it stops Mate, deletes the database, the settings, the certificate and the caches, and puts the app itself in the Bin. It asks first, in plain words, and says that the data goes for good and to take a backup from Export / Backup if you want to keep it. It removes **only** Mate's own files, by exact path: the official Leapmotor app stores its data right next to Mate's, and nothing here goes looking for anything by name. The button appears only in the desktop app on macOS — Home Assistant and Docker have their own way of being removed, and on Windows the system's own uninstaller does this properly already.
- **Mate says when a newer version of the desktop app exists.** The app keeps Mate itself up to date on its own, but the shell around it — the Python runtime and the libraries — is released separately and changes rarely. When a newer one is published, an amber ↑ now appears beside the app version with a link to the download. It is a note, not an alarm: nothing is broken, and everything keeps working until you get round to it.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Charges, Trips and Wallbox are now a calendar with a search bar**, instead of one long year/month/day accordion. Opening any of those pages used to render your entire history server-side, every time — slower the longer you have used Mate, and with no way to find anything except by scrolling. Now the page arrives as a month of day totals, and clicking a day loads that day. Charges and Trips also gain free-text search (station name or note; trip note) with filters: charge type, cost, kWh and date for charges; drive mode, distance, duration and date for trips. Distance is typed in your own units. From **@hubcasale** (#163).
- **Merging trips has its own view.** The old 🔗 mode revealed connectors inside the rendered tree, which no longer exists now that one day is in the page at a time. The button now opens a list of the pairs that can actually be joined across your whole history, with the same gap slider and the same preview before you commit. From **@hubcasale** (#163).
- **The Wallbox page no longer asks Home Assistant about every session up front.** It compared AC against DC for the whole history to show thirty rows; now it asks only for the day you open. From **@hubcasale** (#163).

### Fixed
- **A rest-drain estimate now says WHY it is uncertain.** A park of nearly two days, properly closed, was labelled *"uncertain estimate (short stop)"* — it was not short. Two independent things make an estimate untrustworthy: too little time to extrapolate a rate from, or too small a drop to tell from sensor rounding. The label only knew how to say the first, which sent you looking for a fault in the wrong place. Reported by **@riri19** (#160).

### Changed
- **Mate asks for confirmation in its own dialog.** Deleting a charge or unlocking the car used to raise the browser's own box, which announces the address Mate is served from — *"192.168.1.50 says"* on Home Assistant, *"127.0.0.1:4000 says"* in the desktop app. The question is now asked in a panel that looks like the rest of Mate. Escape and clicking away cancel; nothing is sent until you say so.

### For the desktop app
Only visible inside the standalone app — Home Assistant and Docker never see any of it.
- **A "Start at login" switch**, in Settings → App. Mate records only while it is open, and this is the part of that you can do something about. The switch stores nothing but a yes/no: everything that knows what a login item or a registry entry is lives in the app itself, so the same switch drives both macOS and Windows.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Charging stations you've used now carry a link to their own listing page.** A 🔗 next to the station name on the Charges page opens it on OpenStreetMap or Open Charge Map, where you can see the sockets, the photos and whatever else the community has recorded about it — useful when you're deciding whether to go back. Charges labelled before this version have no link saved; **Settings → Charging stations → Recover missing links** fills them in without touching the names you already have. The same link, and the street address, now also appear on the results of **Find chargers** — including the TomTom ones, which have no page of their own and borrow one from whichever other source covers the same spot. From **@hubcasale** (#162).
- **A 📍 recalculate button on each charge**, for when the name Mate picked isn't the one you'd use. The automatic pass has to choose in silence and takes the nearest match; pressing the button runs the search again and, when the sources genuinely disagree — a service area is routinely listed under the network's name by one source and the site's name by another, tens of metres apart — it shows you both and lets you say which is right. If the search comes back empty, the name you already had is left exactly as it was. From **@hubcasale** (#162).
- **Verify keys**, in Settings → Charging stations: a live check of your Open Charge Map and TomTom keys against the real service, before saving them — so a mistyped key is caught there and then instead of quietly returning nothing for weeks.
- **The estimated range at 100 %**, under the current range on the Overview: what this battery would give you on a full charge at your current consumption. From **@domevite** (#161).
- **A map marker threshold**, in Settings → Charging stations. By default every station you've used gets a marker, including a charger you stopped at once on a trip — which is precisely the stop you're least likely to remember unaided. If your map is crowded with one-offs, raise it to show only the places you return to. From **@hubcasale** (#162).

### Changed
- **When two sources describe the same charging station, the one with more to say now wins.** Before, whichever happened to be nearest became the label — an artifact of the order the sources answered in, not a measure of what they knew — so a bare pin could hide a source that had the sockets, the power and the address. The richer entry is now the one kept, and the other fills in whatever fields it's still missing. From **@hubcasale** (#162).

### For the desktop app
Groundwork for the standalone Mac app, which packages Mate for people who run neither Home Assistant nor Docker. **None of this appears on Home Assistant or Docker** — it's keyed on a variable only the app's launcher sets.
- The update badge no longer sends you to GitHub: the app fetches the new version by itself on the next launch, so it says *"updates on the next restart"* instead. It turns red, with a real download link, only for an update the app has **refused** because it is too old to run it — the one case that never arrives on its own.
- The app's own version is shown next to Mate's (`v2.9.0 · D1.0.0`), in the sidebar and in the diagnostics bundle, so a report from the app can say which build produced it.
- A dismissible notice that **the app records only while it is open**: anything the car does after you close it is not saved, and cannot be filled in afterwards — the cloud keeps no history to replay.

## [2.8.9] — 2026-07-24

### Changed
- **The altitude on the trip chart is a plain line again, like SoC and speed.** It was drawn as a filled area — a soft gradient when the profile arrived in 2.7.0, then a flat opaque slab in 2.8.3 — and the fill had become the loudest thing on the chart, a brown mass covering the two lines the chart exists to show. The terrain reads perfectly well as an outline, and it now has the same weight as the other two series, so the plot is about the drive again with the ground as context rather than the subject. Nothing else changes: the dashed segments across signal drop-outs stay, and so do the gain/loss figures. Raised by **@pdifeo** (#159).

## [2.8.8] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Cars west of Greenwich are no longer moved out to sea by the Refresh button.** A B10 in Portugal appeared on the map off the coast of Sardinia, and went back there every time its owner refreshed. The cloud sends each coordinate twice — once with its sign, once as a bare magnitude — and Mate has two places that read it: the poller, which picks the signed pair and got this right, and the web, which keeps its own copy of that parsing for the write that follows a **command** or the **Refresh** button. That second copy read the magnitude, so the newest position was filed at *plus* 9.14° instead of *minus* 9.14°. Since the map shows the newest position, one refresh was enough to send the car to Italy. The stored history was never wrong — only the last row was — so nothing needs repairing: the next refresh puts the marker back. This is the same fault as the UK car plotted in the North Sea (#30), fixed then in the poller alone; nothing east of Greenwich could ever show it, which is why the second copy went unnoticed. It mirrored the **latitude** too, so cars in the southern hemisphere were thrown into the opposite one. Reported with a diagnostics bundle by **@Andreexylus** (#158).

### Changed
- **The diagnostics bundle now describes the shape of the GPS data, without any coordinates.** Every coordinate signal is stripped from a bundle to protect your address — but that also made the bug above invisible to triage, since nothing in the bundle could say whether a car even sends the signed pair. Bundles now list which coordinate signals arrive and which hemisphere Mate has learned, and no position. The `/api/debug/signals` endpoint — written specifically to diagnose this class of problem — was likewise not listing the signed signals at all, and now shows them alongside what Mate would actually store.

## [2.8.7] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **"Fully charged" no longer appears while a range-extender is still charging.** A REEV can raise its own *charge complete* flag with the battery at 23 % and the limit set to 90 %, switching it on and off part-way through a charge — and Mate was repeating that faithfully, so the Overview and the Charges page announced a finished charge while the car was visibly filling. Mate now checks that claim against the battery before showing it: if the charge is nowhere near the point the car was told to stop at, the flag is ignored. It stays deliberately forgiving — a charge that stops a few percent short of the limit is still "complete" — and it only ever applies when Mate actually knows the limit, so a legitimate flag can't be suppressed for want of a reference. **Only range-extenders are affected**; fully-electric cars report this correctly and are left exactly as they are. Spotted by **@michapr** alongside the charge-detection issue in the same report.

## [2.8.6] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **A range-extender charging at home is finally recorded.** On a REEV, a home AC charge could go completely unlogged — no session at all, so the energy and cost simply never appeared. The reason is that these cars report neither of the two things Mate looks for: the cable state stays at "connected" instead of switching to "charging", and the pack current reads about a tenth of an amp instead of a real charge current. A tester's diagnostics settled it beyond doubt — across fifteen days the poller never once entered the charging state, while the battery visibly climbed the whole time. Mate now takes the climb itself as the evidence: **on a REEV, parked with the cable in and the battery genuinely rising, that's a charge**, whatever the cable and current claim. The rise is measured cumulatively from the moment you plug in rather than between two readings, because on these cars the battery moves one 0.1 % step at a time — which is also the sensor's own resolution, so comparing consecutive readings would either miss the charge or fire on noise. A charge that's merely *scheduled* and waiting for its slot, with the battery flat, still correctly does **not** open a session, and neither does driving on the generator. **Fully-electric cars are untouched** — the new path is gated strictly on the car reporting a fuel tank, so a BEV can never reach it. Thanks to **@michapr**, whose diagnostics and patient re-testing pinned this down.

## [2.8.5] — 2026-07-23

### Changed
- **The OTA check now records what it saw**, so a diagnostics bundle can explain *why* the Overview shows "None" for updates. Leapmotor has no OTA-status signal — nothing the car reports says an update is pending — so Mate can only scan your account's message inbox for an "update available" notice. That meant a bare "None" hid three very different situations that looked identical: the inbox is empty (the car downloaded the update without ever posting a message), there are messages but none is an update, or the inbox couldn't be read at all for your account/region. The poller now logs which of the three it is (and warns, rather than staying silent, when the message endpoint doesn't answer). No behaviour change to detection itself — this only makes the existing check observable. Prompted by **@ghuaywen-ai** (#156).

## [2.8.4] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **A range-extender charging slowly at home is logged again.** On the B10 and C10 REEV, a slow AC charge at home could go completely unrecorded — no session on the Charges page, even though the car was plugged in and filling. Two things about how these cars report a charge defeated the detector, both confirmed from real diagnostic bundles going back weeks: the pack current reads about **zero** the whole time (the on-board charger feeds the battery by a path that sensor doesn't measure, so the usual "is current flowing?" test never triggered), and the cable-state signal **flickers** between three values mid-charge — one of which Mate read as "unplugged", so it kept closing and reopening the session and shredding one charge into a string of tiny fragments, each then discarded as empty. On a genuinely slow charge every fragment was empty and the whole thing vanished. Mate now trusts the cable's own "charging" state together with the ticking-down remaining time when the current is zero, and treats that third cable state as still-connected so the flicker no longer splits the session. Driving and a scheduled charge waiting for its slot are unaffected — both are still correctly *not* a charge. Thanks to **@michapr** and **@ebagnoli**, whose bundles made the signature clear. Full-electric cars are untouched: the new path only opens for the exact zero-current signature a REEV produces.

## [2.8.3] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **The terrain no longer vanishes where the car lost signal.** On a trip with a telemetry drop-out, the profile chart opened a hole: battery and speed went blank — correctly, since nobody knows what they were — but the altitude line went blank with them, and the ground under the car hadn't stopped existing. The relief now continues across the gap as a **dashed line**, drawn straight between the last and the next known altitude, so a climb reads as one continuous silhouette instead of two disconnected halves. The dash is the point: that stretch is reconstructed, not measured. Battery and speed still stop at the edge of the gap, exactly as before. The altitude band is also filled in a flat tone now rather than a fade, which makes the shape of the ground easier to read at a glance. Thanks to **[@hubcasale](https://github.com/hubcasale)**, whose PR #155 this is.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-07-21

### Security
- **A page on another website can no longer make Mate do things.** Mate's API can unlock the doors, and standalone Docker ships with no password — the `MATE_AUTH_PASSWORD` variable is opt-in and, realistically, almost nobody sets it. That combination meant the attacker who mattered was never someone on your network: it was any web page open in *your* browser, which is already inside it. A page could quietly submit a request to Mate on your home address, and the browser would deliver it — the reply is unreadable to the attacker, but the car has already unlocked. **Mate now refuses any request that changes something and declares it came from somewhere else.** A request with no origin at all still works, because that's `curl`, a script or a Home Assistant automation, and browsers always declare an origin on the attack this blocks. Mate also **refuses to be embedded in another page**, which closes the other half of the same trick — a hidden frame with a button lined up over *Unlock*, where the click genuinely happens inside Mate and no origin check could ever see it. Running as a Home Assistant add-on is unaffected throughout: ingress already authenticates every request, and it deliberately embeds the panel. If you reach Mate through a reverse proxy that rewrites the host, `MATE_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` lets you list the address it should accept.
- **The password can now be switched on from the page.** The login has existed for months, but turning it on meant editing a compose file and restarting a container — so the protection existed and nobody had it. *Settings → Access* now takes a password directly, and a banner says plainly when there isn't one, because the stake is physical rather than abstract: anything on your network can open Mate, and Mate can open your car. The password is stored as a salted hash and never in clear text, so a backup or a diagnostics bundle carries nothing usable. `MATE_AUTH_PASSWORD` keeps working exactly as before and takes precedence — if it's set, the page says so instead of quietly ignoring what you type. The banner can be dismissed for good; someone running Mate on localhost only, or behind their own authentication, isn't wrong.
- **The login now has a brake.** One shared password and no account to lock meant anything on the network could try a wordlist as fast as it could send requests. Five wrong attempts from the same address now close the door for five minutes, and the page tells you *that's* what happened rather than showing the same "wrong password" — because the person who hits it is usually the owner.

### Added
- **Charging stations on the map, and a per-station view of your charges.** Every completed charge is now grouped by where it physically happened, and the map draws each spot as its own marker: the station's name where Mate has resolved one, how many times you've charged there, the energy and the cost, the most recent sessions, and a link straight through to the Charges page filtered to just that station. Home charging stays off this layer — a wallbox isn't a public charger, and being nearly everyone's most-visited spot it would otherwise sit on the map as one enormous unnamed bubble. A station you used only once still gets a marker: that's the charger you stopped at on a trip, which is exactly the one you're least likely to remember unaided.

### Fixed
- **Mate no longer picks the wrong vehicle in three places.** An internal lookup asked the database for "a vehicle" without saying which one, and SQLite is free to answer in whichever order it finds convenient — in practice, by chassis number. Two of those three places *write*: the sleep-time charge reconstruction (which can add charges to your history) and the telemetry saved right after a command. Nobody could have hit this yet, because it needs a second car, but it was found by building exactly that case and it's closed now.
- **The charge list's session counts are translated.** The year, month and day rows of the Charges tree spelled "sessions" in English regardless of your language, and with an English plural rule. All three now follow the interface language, singular and plural.
- **The demo no longer errors on the vehicle page.** The bundled sample data predated the climate card, so the vehicle status panel returned an error for anyone trying Mate without a car.

### Credits
- The charging-station map layer is **[@hubcasale](https://github.com/hubcasale)**'s work in PR #153 — the clustering, the map layer, the popup and the per-station filter on the Charges page are his. He also turned a review round on it in a morning, including keying the home-charging exclusion to the wallbox position Mate learns by itself so it works on a fresh install with nothing tagged. Thank you 🙏

## [2.8.1] — 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- **A public charge is no longer mistaken for a home/wallbox session.** A home wallbox stays reachable while you charge somewhere else entirely, so its energy counter still answered — and Mate attributed that reading to the away-from-home charge. Two things went wrong: the public charge was excluded from the 📍 charging-station name lookup (it looked like it happened on your wallbox), and if you measure the wallbox through an energy meter that also sees its standby draw, the counter slowly *creeps* while the car is away — enough, at slower poll rates, to be counted as real home energy and shift that charge's cost. Mate now learns where your wallbox is (from the charges where it actually delivered energy) and simply doesn't attribute its counter to a charge it knows happened far away. It stays deliberately cautious: a charge with no GPS fix (a garage or underground box), or any install that hasn't seen enough home charges yet, is attributed exactly as before — so a genuine home charge is never dropped. Thanks to **@hubcasale** for surfacing the mis-attribution in #152.
- **The diagnostics bundle now reproduces your battery page.** The standby-drain section of the downloadable diagnostics recomputed with the *default* minimum-parking-duration instead of the one you set under *Settings → Advanced*, so anyone who had raised that threshold got a bundle that listed more (and shorter) parked windows than their own chart shows — a discrepancy that could send troubleshooting down the wrong path. It now honours your setting and prints it in the header. Thanks to **@riri19** (#154), whose bundle made the mismatch visible.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Set the car's charging plan from Home Assistant.** Until now the charge schedule — start time, end time, target level, which days — could only be set inside Mate's own interface, which left it invisible to automations. Mate now publishes a **Charge Schedule** entity over MQTT that accepts a small JSON plan, e.g. `{"start":"23:00","stop":"07:00","soc":90,"active":true}`, so you can drive it from an automation: charge when electricity is cheapest, when your solar is producing, or on any condition Home Assistant can express. **Every field is optional, and anything you leave out keeps its current value** — an automation can send just `{"start":"23:00"}` and the rest of your plan stays exactly as it was. Bad input (malformed JSON, an impossible time, a target outside 50–100 %) is refused outright rather than half-applied, and the entity reports back the plan that was actually written so Home Assistant doesn't show an empty box. Thanks to **@chengler**, who worked out the payloads on his own T03 and shared them in #151 — the tests replay his exact sequence.

## [2.7.1] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- **Changing the charge limit from Home Assistant no longer wipes a "start time only" charging plan.** If your car has an enabled charge plan with just a start time and no weekday selection, moving the *Charge Limit* number in Home Assistant silently **disabled that plan and reset its start to 00:00** — so the car simply stopped charging overnight, with nothing visibly going wrong to explain it. This is the same upstream quirk that was fixed for the web UI back in v2.5.8 (the library's charge-limit helper falls back to an all-defaults, schedule-disabled payload whenever the cloud omits the weekday mask — which is exactly what it does for start-time-only plans), but the MQTT path was still calling that helper directly. It now performs the same read-modify-write the web UI does: **only the target SoC changes**, while the plan's enabled state, start/end window, days, circulation and recharge all round-trip untouched. Owners whose plan has weekdays selected were never affected. Thanks to @chengler, whose charge-scheduler experiments (#151) led to this being spotted.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Elevation profile and outside temperature for every trip.** The Leapmotor cloud reports neither altitude nor an outside-temperature signal — only latitude/longitude and the cabin temperature. Mate now looks each finished trip's GPS track up against [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) (free, keyless, no account) shortly after the trip ends, and the trip detail gains three things: an **altitude line** on the *SoC & speed* chart — a topographic cross-section drawn under your telemetry — the trip's total **elevation gain and loss** (↑ climbed / ↓ descended), and the **outside temperature at the departure point and at the arrival point**. The temperature is deliberately *not* an average: it's read at each point's own place and hour, so a valley-to-pass climb shows the real drop instead of hiding it. Together these explain a good part of a trip's consumption — a climb costs energy, cold costs range. It runs quietly in the background (the same render-triggered sweep as the other post-trip enrichments), one lookup per trip; a trip whose lookup fails simply shows "—" and retries on the next sweep, up to a small ceiling, and trips recorded before this feature existed get a **Calculate elevation** button right on the page. Only the trip's GPS points ever leave the device, and the whole thing can be switched off in *Settings*. Elevation follows your measurement system (m / ft), and the chart's altitude line only appears on trips that have been enriched.

### Credits
- The elevation groundwork comes from **[@hubcasale](https://github.com/hubcasale)**'s work in PR #147: the post-trip enrichment sweep, the per-point altitude storage with read-time interpolation, the chart's third series and the recalculate button are his design. This release switches the lookup to **Open-Meteo** — ~300× the free quota of Open-Elevation, finer 90 m terrain data, and it can return the temperature in the same trip — and adds the outside temperature on top. Thank you 🙏

## [2.6.1] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **The car picture now updates when the colour changes.** Mate downloads your car's image (with its real model and colour) from the Leapmotor cloud, but it only did so once and then cached it forever — so a car whose colour was still provisional in the cloud at first setup (typical of a brand-new car) could stay showing the wrong colour indefinitely. Mate now re-downloads the picture **once after each restart** (so every Mate update refreshes it), while still serving the cached image instantly the rest of the time and keeping it if the cloud is briefly unreachable. Thanks to @TripelJ for spotting it (a new B10 that reads purple in the cloud and the official app but showed white in Mate) — #143.
- **The T03 no longer shows controls it doesn't have.** The T03 has no heated or ventilated seats and no heated steering wheel, but Mate was still exposing those entities and buttons (they come from capabilities the car's firmware declares but the European T03 doesn't physically have — the same quirk as its climate). They're now hidden on the T03, in the web UI **and** in Home Assistant, leaving only what it actually has (e.g. the heated mirrors). Cabin and battery temperature are unaffected. Verified against the official European spec. Thanks to @staffhotel-beep for the report (#144).
- **The charge-schedule view is simplified for cars that only do a simple plan.** The Scheduling page offered an end-time and day-of-week picker, but a car like the T03 only supports a start time + target charge level — so those extra fields did nothing there. Mate now shows them only on cars that declare weekly/cyclic charging, leaving the T03 with just start time and target SoC. What the car receives is unchanged. Thanks to @chengler (#146).

## [2.6.0] — 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Pick your time zone.** Trips, charges and reports are shown in local time — but that time used to come only from wherever Mate happened to be running, so a bare Docker container (or a Home Assistant whose zone Mate couldn't read) showed everything in UTC, hours off. Settings → *Language & Currency* now has a **Time zone** selector: leave it on **Automatic** to keep using the container/HA zone exactly as before, or pick your own from the full list of world zones. It's display-only — your stored data always stays UTC — and it applies everywhere at once, so every past trip and charge re-aligns the moment you set it. Daylight-saving is handled automatically. Time-of-use charges are priced in the selected zone from here on (existing charges keep the cost they were recorded with, as always). Thanks to @dsbloomer for the request (#145).

## [2.5.18] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **The "Unlock Charge Cable" button is hidden on cars that can't do it.** The T03 can't release the charge cable remotely — the official app has no such option either — but Mate showed the button anyway, where it simply did nothing. Mate now gates command buttons on the abilities the car itself declares: any model that doesn't report the unlock-cable capability no longer shows the button, in the web UI and in Home Assistant (MQTT), and the command is refused server-side with a clear "not supported on this model" instead of being bounced off the car. This is model-blind — it reads what each car declares about itself, so it also covers other models present and future, with no per-model list to maintain. Climate is deliberately left out of this (the T03 under-declares its climate abilities yet the A/C works — #67), so nothing there changes. Thanks to @chengler for the report and the diagnostics (#142).

## [2.5.17] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **The setup wizard no longer offers a range-extender battery.** Mate supports **battery-electric cars only**, but its first-run wizard was still listing a range-extender pack among the battery variants for the B10 and the C10 — visible to anyone setting up either model, not only to range-extender owners, since the cloud reports just the model name. Choosing it configured the car as something Mate has no support for, and the energy figures that followed could not add up. The wizard now offers the battery-electric packs only, and the page no longer carries the variant at all. **Existing installs are untouched**: this is the first-run screen, and no configured car is changed. Range-extender owners are served by the separate BetaTester build, which is where that support is being developed. Thanks to @pdifeo for the question that surfaced it (#141).

### Changed
- **The wizard's battery list now comes from one place.** The list existed twice — once in the server and once hardcoded in the setup page — and the two copies had already drifted apart (gross vs usable figures for the same B10 packs). The page is now rendered from the server's list, so the two can no longer disagree.

## [2.5.16] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Trips no longer record phantom data when the car goes off-grid.** When the car can't reach Leapmotor's cloud — a 4G dead zone, or the eSIM re-registering onto a foreign network after a border crossing — the cloud doesn't report the outage: it keeps re-serving the **last frame it received**, unchanged, for as long as the car stays away. Mate was recording each of those repeats as a real sample, which invented data: a speed plateau frozen at the last reading, dozens of GPS points stacked on the same spot, and an **average speed inflated** by them. Mate now recognises a re-served frame (the frame's own timestamp doesn't change) and, while driving, records nothing for it — so the trip chart shows an honest **gap** for the stretch the car was unreachable, instead of a confident flat line through minutes that never happened. Distance and efficiency were already correct and are unchanged: the odometer catches up the moment the link returns. Parked cars are unaffected — a sleeping car legitimately freezes for hours. Thanks to @Wartopia for the report and the diagnostics that pinned it down (#128).

## [2.5.15] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Portuguese: the Maintenance page is now translated too.** The maintenance schedule — service items, categories and the due/overdue wording — was the last part of the interface still showing in English for Portuguese users, and is now fully in European Portuguese. Thanks to @danielvilhena for the contribution (#139).

## [2.5.14] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Windows and sunshade/roof commands over MQTT.** Open/close the windows (a quick vent to 20%) and the sunshade roof directly from Home Assistant — four new buttons that until now existed only in the web UI. Ideal for automations, e.g. auto-close the sunshade when the car arrives home. Like every physical command, the car only acts on them while parked. Thanks to @SgtMajorSnipr for the request (#138).

## [2.5.13] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Portuguese (Portugal) translation.** Mate is now available in European Portuguese (`pt-PT`) — a complete translation of the whole interface, selectable in Settings and during first-time setup. Thanks to @danielvilhena for the contribution (#137).

## [2.5.12] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **REEV: fuel cost — log your refuels and see what each engine-on trip cost (beta).** A new **Rifornimenti** page lets you record each refuel (litres + price per litre, *or* the total paid — the other is computed). Mate keeps a **weighted-average price** of the fuel currently in the tank — a big cheap fill drags it down, a small pricey top-up nudges it up, exactly like a tank that's "part bought at price X, part at price Y" — and prices each engine-on trip's fuel at the average in effect **at the time of that trip**. The per-trip dual-energy view now shows the **fuel cost** next to the litres, and the page shows the live tank state (level from the car, average €/L, estimated value). Prices are shown to 3 decimals with the UI's decimal separator. Visible on the REEV research build only, and only on range-extender cars; battery-electric cars and the official build are unaffected.

## [2.5.11] — 2026-07-12

### Changed
- **REEV: regen is no longer shown.** Mate infers regen from "battery charging while driving" — but on a range-extender that is indistinguishable from the **generator** charging the battery, and the cloud API exposes no dedicated regen signal to tell the two apart. Rather than display an inflated, misleading number, the regen field is now hidden on range-extender cars everywhere it appeared (trip detail, statistics, trip list, monthly report). **Battery-electric cars are unaffected.**

### Added
- **REEV: per-trip dual-energy view, and the electric side now comes only from the cloud (beta).** An engine-on range-extender trip now shows both of its energies side by side — the **electric** consumption from the car's own metered cloud figure (getEC) and the **fuel** used (L + L/100 km). The electric side is sourced **only from getEC, never from the battery SoC**: on a REEV the generator recharges the pack *while you drive*, so the net SoC change isn't the motor's consumption — it can even go *up*. getEC counts real consumption regardless of where it comes from, so it stays correct even then; a trip that ends fuller than it started now reads **"battery recharged by generator"** instead of a nonsensical negative number. The REEV page also gains the absolute electric **kWh over the last 7 days** (driving / climate / other) next to the fuel litres. Visible on the REEV research build; battery-electric cars are unaffected. Thanks to @gm27271 and @michapr for the reports and reasoning (MateBetaTesterOnly #10).

## [2.5.10] — 2026-07-11

### Changed
- **Translations moved to per-language JSON files (internal cleanup — no user-facing change).** The UI strings used to live in a single ~4,500-line Python module; they now sit in `web/locales/{en,it,fr,de,pl}.json`, loaded by a small 56-line `i18n` loader with the exact same behaviour. This makes adding or correcting a translation a simple JSON edit (and opens the door to community translations) without touching code. Every string was carried over verbatim — the app looks and behaves identically in all five languages.

## [2.5.9] — 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- **REEV: a trip's electric kWh/100 km is no longer shown when the range-extender ran.** On a range-extender car the generator recharges the battery *while you drive*, so the trip's net SoC change isn't the motor's traction energy — the old per-trip electricity figure (from SoC delta, or from getEC spread over the full distance) came out diluted or near-zero (e.g. 0.5 kWh/100 km where the car itself reported ~19). Mate now **withholds** that figure whenever the extender ran during the trip — at trip close, in the getEC conversion, in merged-trip stats, and via a one-time cleanup of already-recorded trips — so no misleading number shows and no average is polluted. **Pure-electric REEV trips** (fuel level flat) keep a valid figure, and **battery-electric cars are entirely unaffected** (they have no fuel signal). The trip still shows its **fuel** L/100 km (measured over the generator-on distance). Thanks to @gm27271 for the sharp report (MateBetaTesterOnly #10).

## [2.5.8] — 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Setting the charge limit no longer wipes a start-time-only charge schedule.** If you had scheduled charging enabled with only a start time (no end time and no specific days), changing the charge limit could silently **disable the schedule and reset its start time to 00:00**. The cause was in the underlying library's read-modify-write: it keyed on the day mask, and the cloud omits that mask for a start-time-only plan, so it fell back to an all-defaults branch. Mate now round-trips the current plan and changes **only** the target SoC — the schedule's enabled state, start/end window and days are preserved (leapmotor-api #18). Schedules that had specific days set were never affected.

## [2.5.7] — 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Diagnostics bundle is now a ZIP and carries days of logs, not minutes.** The downloadable diagnostics used to include only the last ~300 log lines (≈50 minutes of driving) as a plain-text file — too short to cover a long trip. It now bundles the **full retained poller/web logs** (the active file plus its rotated backups) and ships them **zipped** (plain text compresses ~10×, so the attachment stays small). The poller log also keeps a wider window on disk (≈3 days of continuous driving, longer when parked), so when someone reports a problem a few days later their bundle still spans the whole run-up. VIN and credentials are still masked and GPS is still stripped — the bundle stays safe to share publicly.

### Added
- **Each poll now logs the age of the cloud's telemetry frame.** Every poller status line carries a `Frame age` field (and the odometer) — how old the frame the cloud actually served is. Fresh data reads a few seconds; if the car enters a connectivity dead zone and the cloud keeps re-serving its last frame, the age climbs without bound. That is the signal that tells a *stale* reading apart from the car *genuinely* being stopped — making problems like a trip that stays "in progress" after a border crossing (#128) diagnosable from a single bundle.

## [2.5.6] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Battery health (SoH) — ignore charges that started from a near-empty battery.** A charge begun at a very low state of charge shows up as an isolated low dip in the health graph: near empty, the BMS over-reports the SoC rise, so "energy ÷ SoC gain" under-estimates the pack capacity. Charges starting below 15% are now drawn on the chart in violet but **excluded from the health figure and its average** — the same treatment already given to cold charges and BMS-recalibration jumps. This adds the *bottom* guard to complement the existing *top* one (charges ending near 100%, where the BMS is most accurate, already weigh most), so the trend stays honest at both ends of the LFP curve. Thanks to @riri19 for the precise report (#125).

## [2.5.5] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **REEV per-trip fuel consumption (L/100 km) now matches the car.** On a mixed drive — part on the range-extender, part pure-electric — the litres were spread over the *whole* trip distance, which under-reported the figure. It's now measured over only the distance driven **while the generator was actually running** (the electric kilometres, and any fuel burned while stationary to charge the battery, are excluded), so the per-trip value, the trips list, and the REEV summary all line up with what the car itself shows. The trip card also shows the generator-on distance the figure is based on. Research / BetaTester builds on a REEV vehicle only — nothing changes for BEVs or the normal add-on.

## [2.5.4] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Restore a database backup — carry ALL your data to a new install.** Settings → *Export / Backup* now has a **Restore database** option next to the existing backup download: export your database, reinstall the add-on, sign in, then upload that backup to bring **everything** back — trips, charges, positions, research history, settings — without losing a single row (verified end-to-end). The login you just entered is kept: the backup's own encrypted secrets can't be read on a different install, so you sign in once and Restore preserves that. The backup line also now shows what it contains (trips · charges · positions · size), so you can be sure it's complete before downloading. Foreign or corrupt files are refused without touching your data.

## [2.5.3] — 2026-07-08

### Changed
- **BetaTester channel now updates like any normal add-on.** The data-collection BetaTester add-on was pinned to a fixed `beta` version, so Home Assistant never offered it an update. It now runs the **exact same image and version number** as the regular release and enables its extra data capture through an add-on option instead — so it shows a real version, updates with the normal button, and stays in lockstep with every release. **No change for the normal add-on** (the option is absent there, so nothing is enabled).

## [2.5.2] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **A charge is now tracked from when charging actually starts, not from when the cable is plugged in.** Mate used to open a charging session the moment the cable was connected. With a scheduled (deferred) charge the cable can stay plugged in for hours before any current flows, so the session started counting too early. It now begins only when real charging current is present — the car reporting "charging", or ≥ 2 A — which is the behaviour the state machine documented all along. This removes the empty session at plug-in and, if you meter AC energy with a wallbox counter or a Shelly, keeps the standby draw during those idle plugged-in hours out of the charge's energy and cost (the meter baseline is now taken when charging begins, so those hours fall below it). The cable still ends a trip immediately on plug-in and still keeps one physical charge from splitting across brief current dips.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Trigger commands from scripts, Shortcuts or Home Assistant, and get a JSON reply.** Send `Accept: application/json` to `POST /api/command/{name}` and the endpoint answers with a structured result — `{"ok": true, "status": "done"}` on success, or `{"ok": false, "error": ..., "blocked"/"cooldown"/"retry_in": ...}` — instead of the HTML the web UI uses. So an iOS Shortcut, a smartwatch button, a shell script or a Home Assistant `rest_command` can fire a command and actually know whether it worked, was blocked while driving, or hit the anti-spam cooldown. The browser path is unchanged — JSON only when explicitly requested. Thanks @irek for the idea.

### Fixed
- **The Monthly report now shows the average consumption for a first, partial month too (#121, thanks @Wartopia).** When you install Mate part-way through a month, the report's window still started on the 1st — but the cloud energy figure (getEC) covers those earlier days too (the car reports to the cloud on its own), while Mate only has trips from when it was installed. Pairing the two would give a wrong average, so the report used to leave it blank ("—"). It now aligns the window to your first recorded trip, so the cloud energy and your trip distance cover the same period and the real average shows — the same logic an established month already used. Established months are unchanged.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Range-extender (REEV) support is taking shape in the BetaTester build.** On the BetaTester data-collection build, a range-extender car now gets a **dual-energy Overview** — battery *and* fuel tank side by side (fuel level, range on fuel, and the combined battery+fuel range) — and every **engine-on trip is flagged with its petrol consumption** (litres and L/100 km), so REEV testers can check the new UI against their own car while we finish REEV support. It's exclusive to the **BetaTester build** and to **REEV cars**: a normal Mate — and any battery-only (BEV) car — shows nothing new.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **The Charges page now shows your full history, not just the last 50 (#67, thanks @rossiadobe).** After importing a long charge history from CSV, the list appeared to stop part-way (older charges looked missing) — the grouped Charges view was capped at the 50 most recent charges. The charges were always safely in the database (the CSV export and the monthly report already showed every one); only the on-screen list was truncated. It now loads the complete history, grouped by year / month / day as before.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Mark a home charge as "Free" (#120, thanks @Wartopia).** A home charge that cost you nothing — self-produced solar, or any free top-up at home — can now be flagged **🆓 Free** with a toggle right next to its **Home** badge. The charge **stays under Home**, so it still counts on the Home side of the Home-vs-Public breakdown instead of being lumped into "Public", but its cost is pinned to **0** and protected from any later recompute. It's a manual flag by design: Mate only sees what the wallbox/battery report and **can't tell solar from grid** (there's no metering behind your meter — a session is usually a mix), so whether a charge was "free" is your call, not a measurement. Free charging *away* from home stays the existing **FREE** type; this toggle is Home-only, and switching a charge to any other type clears it.
- **Default drive mode and One-Pedal for new trips (#119, thanks @Wartopia).** Drive mode (Comfort/Normal/Sport) and One-Pedal are never reported by the Leapmotor cloud (verified on-car) and can't be inferred from speed, so they can only be tagged by hand. If you always drive the same way, you can now set your defaults once under **Settings → Trip defaults**, and every **new** trip starts pre-filled instead of "not set" — no more re-tagging each trip. Applies to new trips only (existing ones are untouched), you can still override any single trip afterwards, and the factory default stays "not set" so nothing changes unless you choose one.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Trips driven while the car was offline are now recovered (#118, thanks @riri19).** When your car's modem goes silent during a drive — no live data reaches the cloud, so the trip used to be lost entirely — Mate now rebuilds it from the odometer jump the moment the car comes back online, exactly like it already does for charges missed while the car was asleep. The reconstructed trip **counts in your statistics** (distance, energy, consumption) and is clearly marked **"auto-detected" (✨)**.

  **Please note the limits:**
  - **From now on only.** It catches offline trips from this update onward; trips already lost *before* it are not recovered.
  - **No map/route.** The car sent nothing during the drive, so there's no GPS track — the trip shows distance and consumption but **no route on the map** ("Route not available").
  - **Approximate on unstable connections.** On a flaky car↔cloud link the **duration may be blank** when the offline gap is much longer than the drive, and **several drives inside one long offline gap merge into a single trip** (the totals stay correct, the per-trip split doesn't).
  - **Estimate, not official.** Energy/consumption come from the battery-level drop, not the cloud's official per-trip figure — a reconstructed trip **can't be "converted to official data"** (the cloud never saw it).

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-05

### Internal — no change if you have a single car
- **Multi-vehicle groundwork.** Mate now stores battery capacity **per vehicle** and scopes every page's data (trips, charges, statistics, battery health, maps, diagnostics) to a specific car. This lets a future release show and manage more than one vehicle on the same account without ever mixing their data. On a single-car setup it is completely invisible: the database migration is a no-op that leaves your existing trips and charges untouched, and every screen shows exactly what it did before — verified end-to-end against the full data set. A one-time safety pass also guarantees no historical row can be hidden by the new scoping.
- **REEV research capture (beta build only).** The beta/research build additionally records the cloud's per-100 km electric **and fuel** consumption split, to validate range-extender support from real REEV cars. Inert in the normal build.

## [2.1.9] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Scheduled preparation: saving no longer fails with "Request failed"** (#116, thanks @riri19). A one-time ("once") prepare-car appointment that has already fired used to linger in the list, and since saving *any* schedule re-sends the **whole** list to the car (the cloud only supports full-list replacement), a single spent "once" entry made the car reject the entire batch — so no schedule could be saved or deleted. Mate now drops already-fired "once" appointments from the write: saving works again, and those dead entries get cleared from the car in the process. Recurring (weekday) schedules are untouched — they were never the problem, and the car re-anchors them on its own. These stale "once" entries are typically left over from the official app, since schedules live on the shared Leapmotor cloud.

## [2.1.8] — 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **T03: Mate now shows only what the car actually has.** The T03 has no ventilated seats and no one-touch "Prepare car", so those controls — the seat-ventilation tiles and the Prepare-car page/menu entry — are now hidden on a T03 instead of sitting there inert. It's driven by a small per-model table, so a future model can be tuned the same way in one line. Climate is deliberately left untouched (the T03's climate is handled empirically, #67). **B10/C10/B05 are unchanged.**

### Fixed
- **Wallbox: no more blank, label-less tile** (#114, thanks @Wartopia). On the Wallbox page the "max current" control drew an empty "—" with no label when the wallbox exposes no controllable current entity (e.g. PlugChoice), which read as a broken box. It's now simply hidden in that case; the slider is unchanged for wallboxes that do expose a controllable current. (The other tiles that look empty during a live first session — Wallbox/Battery kWh, Efficiency, Car-vs-Wallbox — are lifetime/comparison values that fill in once the charge completes.)

## [2.1.7] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Maintenance: the km bars now start from the real delivery odometer** (#112, thanks @Wartopia). The delivery editor gained an **"Odometer at delivery (km)"** field — set it (0 for a car bought new) so a first-service progress bar reflects the car's actual odometer, not just the kilometres driven since Mate was installed.

## [2.1.6] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **CSV charge import now takes start/end SoC and an end time** (#67, thanks @rossiadobe). The import template has three new **optional** columns — `start_soc`, `end_soc` and `end` (end date/time) — so imported historical charges show their **SoC gain and duration** just like live ones. Still SoH-safe: manual charges stay out of the battery-health estimate.
- **Wallbox "max available" can be a fixed value** (#111, thanks @Wartopia). If your wallbox exposes no sensor for its maximum power/current, you can now type a **static value** (kW or A) in the wallbox mapping and the live tile fills from it. A mapped sensor still wins; display-only, it never affects cost.
- **T03: an experimental "A/C off" test page** (#67). The T03's remote A/C-off is unsolved across the whole ecosystem, so — **for T03 owners only** — a card in Settings opens a page to try candidate off commands (plus fan/heat/recirculation probes) on the real car and report what works. Temporary; it'll be removed once the command is found.

## [2.1.5] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Bulk-import past charges from a CSV** (idea from #111, thanks @Wartopia). The Charges page now has an **Import from CSV** section next to "Add a past charge": download an empty, self-documenting template, fill one row per charge (date, energy, optional cost, AC/DC) in Excel/Numbers/any editor, and upload it. Every line is validated strictly — a bad date, future date, non-numeric or absurd energy, negative cost or unknown type is rejected and reported with its line number, while the good lines still import — so one typo never blocks the file and nothing dirty reaches the database. Both `,`+`.` (US) and `;`+`,` (European Excel) CSV formats are auto-detected.
- **Diagnostics: the car's declared abilities.** The diagnostics bundle now lists the ability codes the vehicle itself reports (`VehicleAbility`), with the comfort features called out (seat heating/ventilation, heated steering). This is ground truth for what a given model actually supports — so remote-control gaps (like the T03's fan/off, #67) can be told apart from "the car doesn't have that feature," and a new model (e.g. the B05) is understood the moment it connects rather than assumed. Read-only; all models. The poller stores the abilities on start, so restart the add-on once on this version before downloading a fresh diagnostic.

## [2.1.4] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **T03: A/C on, temperature, fan and recirculation now take effect** (#67, thanks @rossiadobe for the live logs). On the T03 these controls were sent as an `operate=auto` climate command, which the car accepts (the cloud returns success) but silently ignores — so the **A/C** button didn't start it, and the **temperature**, **fan** and **recirculation** changes did nothing. On the **T03 only** they now send the `operate=manual` command the car actually honors (the same path the working **Cool** button already uses); when no manual mode is active, the A/C button starts in cooling. **B10/C10/B05 are completely unchanged.** (The separate **A/C Off** button is still under investigation — the T03 ignores the off command too, which needs the car's real off command.)

## [2.1.3] — 2026-07-03

### Changed
- **Richer support diagnostics.** The diagnostics bundle's cost & wallbox section now shows, per charge, the exact stored `ac_energy` value, whether the card is billing on the wallbox (AC) or the battery (DC), and the wallbox counter baseline — so cost/wallbox questions (#109) can be diagnosed at a glance. Combined with the A/C-off command logging already added in 2.1.2 (#67), a single fresh diagnostic now captures exactly what the car reports and does.

## [2.1.2] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **T03: an explicit "A/C Off" button** (#67, thanks @rossiadobe for the live logs). On the T03 the car reports its climate as "off" even when it's actually running, so the climate tiles could never switch it off. A dedicated **A/C Off** button now appears **on the T03 only** and sends the off command directly, bypassing that unreliable state. B10/C10/B05 are completely unchanged.
- **Charges: removed the "actual charge" time window** (#109, thanks @riri19). It was derived from the last sample with live power, which under-reports the end time whenever the car sleeps mid-charge (the cloud stops reporting power) — showing a confusing, wrong end time. Removed.

### Added
- **Diagnostics: cost & wallbox section** — the shareable diagnostics bundle now includes the pricing mode per charge type, base prices, the wallbox entity mapping and the last few charges (DC / AC / cost), so cost questions can be diagnosed from a single file.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **T03: the A/C now turns off** (#67, thanks @Gr1m214 for the report). On the T03, Mate's "A/C off" was accepted by the cloud but ignored by the car — you could switch the climate on, never off. The off command is now **model-specific**: the T03 uses the car's dedicated `ac_off` action, while the **B10 and C10 keep their confirmed off command unchanged** (B05 too). No change to how you use it — "A/C off" simply works on the T03 now.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Automatic preparation when the car turns on (Ready).** A new automation on the **Vehicle Preparation** page fires the exact same one-shot preparation as tapping **Prepare Now** — climate, windows, per-seat heating/ventilation, heated steering and mirrors — but automatically, the moment the car goes **Ready** (powered on). You configure once what it should do; it then runs by itself on every start.
  - **Optional interior-temperature condition.** You can gate it on the cabin temperature: run *only* when it's **above** a threshold (e.g. pre-cool above 25 °C) or *only* **below** one (e.g. pre-heat below 5 °C). **Leave the condition off and it runs on every Ready, unconditionally.** The check is on the **interior** temperature — the cloud exposes no outside-temperature signal — and it's evaluated **once**, at the instant the car turns on (a later temperature change during the same drive won't re-trigger it).
  - **Fires once per Ready session**, not repeatedly: it won't re-run while you stay on, nor for a later trip within the same on-session. It's debounced against brief signal blips and is restart-safe (a poller restart never re-fires a preparation that already ran).
  - Windows snap to the levels the car actually honors (0 / 20 / 50 / 100 % on the B10), the same as the manual control.
- **User notes on charges and trips** (#107, thanks @riri19 for the suggestion).
  - A free-text **note on each charge** (station location, shade/shelter, reliability, parking, weather, personal remarks) — context the raw numbers can't capture, right above *Delete charge*.
  - A free-text **note on each trip**, plus **manual driving tags**: drive mode (Comfort / Normal / Sport) and One-Pedal (on/off). The Leapmotor cloud doesn't report drive mode or One-Pedal, so these are set by hand — they help explain why two similar trips consumed differently.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Dynamic pricing no longer mis-prices charges away from home** (#106, thanks @twiktorowicz for the report). Since 2.0.0, selecting the Dynamic mode applied your home tariff sensor to **every** charge — including public AC/DC/HPC sessions, which the operator bills at their own fixed price, not at your home spot price (on spot markets some hours cost close to zero, so away-charge costs could be wildly wrong or near-free, silently). The pricing mode is now **per charge type**: Home, AC, DC and HPC each pick Fixed (24h) or Time slots, and Home can also go Dynamic (no HA integration exposes a price for public charging, so Dynamic is offered on Home only). Existing dynamic setups are corrected automatically on update: your sensor keeps pricing **home** charging exactly as before, while public types return to their fixed base prices. Fixed and Time-slots setups are untouched. Already-computed costs stay frozen as always — the fix applies to future charges (re-confirming a charge's type badge recomputes it).
- Selecting Dynamic no longer locks you out of the other modes: time bands and fixed prices now coexist with it per charge type (e.g. home on the tariff sensor **and** a public AC network on its own time bands). A time-band price cell for a type not currently on Time slots is greyed out and disabled — it used to look live and editable while silently never being used.
- While Home is Dynamic, its base-price field is hidden rather than shown as editable (it's a fallback only, used when the sensor misses or a charge is still in progress) — an editable price sitting right next to "Dynamic" looked like the real, current price.

### Added
- **Groundwork for total-energy statistics**: once a day Mate now quietly records the car's official lifetime energy and mileage counters from the cloud (the same "total energy" the vehicle itself reports, parked/standby consumption included) alongside the official driving split for the same window. Nothing visible yet — this ledger is what upcoming features (total & parked energy per period) will be built on, and the earlier you run a version that records it, the further back those stats will reach.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **No more impossible average consumption on driving-energy windows that start before Mate was installed** (#105, thanks @riri19 for the report). The official cloud figure covers the car's whole life, but Mate's local trip history only starts at install — pairing the two on the "Since the beginning" preset (or any custom range starting earlier than your first recorded trip) produced a meaningless kWh/100km. Such windows now show the official energy split alone, with a note giving the date your local trip stats begin; ranges fully covered by Mate keep the Distance/Duration/Average row as before.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Dynamic electricity pricing from a Home Assistant sensor** (#104, thanks @Wartopia for the idea). If you're on a dynamic/spot-price contract (Nordpool, Tibber, ENTSO-E, or your utility's own integration), Mate can now price each charging session from that sensor's history instead of a fixed price — new "Dynamic (HA sensor)" mode on the Prices page, next to Flat and Time-of-use. **Requires Home Assistant** (add-on or a standalone install connected to HA) with a price-per-kWh sensor to point at; without one, or whenever it's briefly unreachable, Mate falls back to your flat base price so a session is never left uncosted.
- Not a breaking change — if you don't use it, nothing changes. Bumped to 2.0.0 as a milestone after a month of near-daily releases, not because anything existing behaves differently.

## [1.36.2] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Distance, duration and average consumption alongside every official driving-energy card** (Statistics' day/week/month/all-time/since-last-charge, and the Monthly Report) — the same figures the car's own "since last charge" screen shows next to its Driving/A/C/Other split.

### Fixed
- **The Monthly Report's "Average consumption" and "Energy used" tiles now match the official cloud figure shown just above them.** They previously came from summing each trip's own stored value (which falls back to the SoC estimate for the rare trip without cloud data yet), so on a short or recent period they could show a visibly different number than the live official figure right next to them. Both now read from the same official source. Navigating to a past month with ◀/▶ shows that month's own official total (the day/week "quick" tabs only make sense for the current month, so they're hidden on a past one).

## [1.36.1] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **"Since last charge" driving energy card (Statistics page).** Shows the official cloud consumption split (Driving / A/C / Other) for everything driven since the end of your last completed charge — same live figure as the day/week/month/all-time cards, just anchored to your last charge instead of a calendar period.

## [1.36.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Map cursor synced to the SoC/speed chart on the trip detail page.** Hovering the chart now shows a cyan marker on the map at the exact GPS position recorded at that moment, following the cursor as it moves and disappearing when the mouse leaves the chart — makes it easy to spot where on the route a speed change or SoC drop happened. (#102, thanks @hubcasale)

## [1.35.1] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Official trip consumption (`getEC`) no longer occasionally comes back empty and drops a trip to the estimate.** The query now starts from the **last moment the car was confirmed OFF** (the sample just before power-on) instead of the first poll that detected "Ready". Polling is periodic (~30 s while the car is off), so that first "Ready" poll can land a few seconds *after* the cloud's session anchor — making the official figure return nothing and the trip fall back to the SoC estimate. Anchoring to the last "off" sample is guaranteed to be before the anchor at any polling cadence, so the official figure is caught reliably. (The same trip could succeed on one device and miss on another purely from polling phase — a 4-second difference was enough.)

## [1.35.0] — 2026-06-29

This release makes Mate use the car's real **power-on (Ready) signal** to bound both the official trip consumption and the battery-drain calculation — replacing time-based guesses with the exact moments the car was switched on and off.

### Changed
- **Official trip consumption is now measured from when the car is switched ON (Ready), not from when driving starts.** The cloud's official figure (`getEC`) covers a whole power-on session — from the moment you power up until you switch off — so Mate now aligns its query to that exact window instead of guessing "2 minutes before the drive". This is more accurate and removes the occasional missing/inflated values on the first try.
  - **If the car is never switched off between two trips** (e.g. you stop, stay in Park with the engine on, then drive again), the cloud counts them as **one session**. Mate detects this and asks you to **merge the trips** to get the real combined consumption — merging is now allowed at any gap for trips that share one power-on session, and converts the combined drive over its full distance.
  - A trip whose official figure is implausible versus the battery's actual SoC change is still kept on the reliable estimate (no impossible numbers), and every conversion stays reversible with **"Revert to estimate"**.
- **Battery (vampire) drain is now measured from when the car is COMPLETELY OFF — power-off to the next power-on.** Everything the car consumes while off is counted as drain, **including remote heating/cooling (pre-conditioning) done while the car is off** — by design: car off → it's drain. On‑state idle (parked with the engine on / climate running) is no longer mixed into the drain figure (it belongs to the trip). The Battery-health card explains this.

### Notes
- Both calculations fall back to the previous behaviour for trips/periods recorded before the Ready signal was logged, so existing history is unaffected.

## [1.34.2] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **"Convert with official data" no longer applies an over-inflated cloud figure on very short trips.** On a ~1 km trip the cloud's official consumption (`getEC`) can come back several times larger than the energy that actually left the battery — its window includes the ~2 minutes before you start driving (A/C, standby), which dwarfs a tiny drive — giving an impossible figure like **120 kWh/100 km**. The plausibility guard is now **symmetric**: it refuses a value that is both absurdly **high** *and* far above the trip's real battery use, exactly as it already did for absurdly **low** / incomplete values (#96), keeping the reliable estimate. The message now notes that on very short trips the cloud isn't precise. (Reported in #98.)

## [1.34.1] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **"Convert with official data" no longer overwrites a good estimate with an incomplete cloud figure.** On some trips the cloud's official consumption (`getEC`) comes back only partially aggregated — a value that would imply an impossible efficiency (e.g. a 33 km drive showing **1.5 kWh/100 km**). The button now **refuses** such a value and keeps the reliable SoC estimate, cross‑checking the cloud figure against the trip's actual battery use (ΔSoC × pack) so a genuinely low‑consumption trip is still accepted. No data is ever lost. (Reported in #96.)

### Added
- **"Revert to estimate" button** on a converted trip — undo an official‑data conversion and restore the SoC estimate at any time (you can convert again later). Every conversion is now fully reversible from the trip page.
- **Arrival odometer** on the trip detail, right under the start odometer. (#95)
- **Regeneration and cost per period** — the kWh recovered and the period's cost are now shown on the **year / month / day** rows of the Trips list, next to the existing distance and consumption. (#95)

### Changed
- **"Efficiency" is now labelled "Average consumption"** across the app (Trips, Statistics, Report, trip detail) — closer to the universal automotive wording. Charge efficiency (%) is unchanged. (#95)

## [1.34.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Official trip consumption from the Leapmotor cloud.** Each trip's **energy, efficiency and cost** now use Leapmotor's **official figure** — the real **driving / A·C / other** split from the cloud (`getEC`) — when it's available, instead of only the battery‑% (SoC) estimate. The trip detail shows the **breakdown**, and the official numbers flow through into the **Report** and **Statistics** aggregates. While the cloud is still aggregating a fresh trip the figure is the SoC estimate marked **⏳ provisional**, then it **swaps to the official number on its own** once it stabilises (the SoC value is kept as a fully reversible backup). The feature is **always on** and degrades gracefully: if the cloud hasn't recorded a trip — which happens occasionally on any connected car — that trip simply stays on the SoC estimate, never an error.
- **"Convert with official data" button** on any trip that isn't official yet — it works for older trips too (the cloud retains the data well beyond a week). If two trips were really one drive split by a very short stop, it tells you to **merge** them; merging then converts the **combined** drive automatically over its full distance (Unmerge reverts cleanly).
- **"Vehicle Cumulative Total" card** (Statistics) — since‑delivery **total energy, total mileage and lifetime kWh/100 km** read from the car's own lifetime counter, plus a **driving / A·C / other / standby** split. The total is counter‑based (not a sum of per‑trip figures), so it is **not affected** by the occasional missing‑trip gaps.
- **Official driving‑consumption views** — Today / This week / This month cards (Report) and a custom date‑range query (Statistics), with the driving / A·C / other split from the cloud.

### Changed
- **Trips list — "Collapse days"** now collapses only the day groups (the month/year structure stays), and collapsing a month re‑collapses its days so re‑opening it is tidy. **Merge mode** no longer expands the whole archive — it opens only the days that actually have a joinable pair. The merge **default gap is now 5 minutes** (a longer stop is a real, separate trip); the slider still opens up to 90 minutes for manual merges.

### Notes
- **Upgrade‑safe**: the new per‑trip columns are added by an automatic, additive migration (verified on a real pre‑feature database — no rows lost, existing trips unchanged). Historical trips keep their SoC values; only trips from the update forward are enriched automatically (older ones can be converted by hand).

## [1.33.2] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Sidebar no longer gets stuck visible at narrow widths after opening the mobile menu.** The off-canvas hide below the `md` breakpoint relied on a Tailwind utility class that the menu toggle itself stripped, and nothing reset the drawer when the viewport crossed the breakpoint — so opening the menu and then resizing could leave the sidebar wrongly showing at narrow widths (it would "reappear" at some resolutions). Open/close now uses a dedicated state class (the hide stays owned purely by CSS) and resets when entering desktop width.
- **Overview hero card: the "doors locked" and "windows closed" status chips no longer overlap.** On a narrow hero card — the 3-column desktop layout, or an iPad viewing the add-on inside Home Assistant's ingress iframe — the two corner-pinned chips printed on top of each other. They now share one self-adapting row that places them at opposite corners when there's room and stacks them when the card is narrow, independent of the label's translation length.

## [1.33.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- **Windows slider no longer shows a stale opening % when the windows are closed.** The B10 can't report its exact window position, so the slider shows the last commanded %; if the windows were then closed via the official app, physically, or the toggle, it could sit at e.g. 100% while the state badge correctly read "Closed". The slider (and its % label) now snap to **0%** whenever the windows are reported closed, matching the badge; open/unknown states are unchanged. The other sliders were audited and are not affected (climate temperature/fan read live signals; seat heating/ventilation track the polled state; settings sliders are configuration values).

## [1.33.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **REEV (range-extender) support — first step.** Setup now offers the **REEV battery variants for the B10 and C10** (the T03 has no REEV), and a new dedicated **REEV** page surfaces the fuel sensors — **fuel level, fuel range and combined battery+fuel range** — for range-extender cars. The page appears automatically on a REEV (detected from the car's fuel signal) and stays hidden on full-electric cars. It is **read-only for now**: REEV data is not yet woven into trips, charges or statistics — that follows once the behaviour is validated on real vehicles. Mapping based on the community work in kerniger/leapmotor-ha#46.
- **Separate MateBetaTesterOnly build (opt-in).** A distinct beta image/repository, kept in lockstep with this one from the same source, captures the full raw-signal history + a tester logbook and exports an **encrypted** bundle — so we can decode REEV behaviour and ship full REEV support in a future release. The normal build is completely unaffected (the research code is inert unless explicitly enabled).

## [1.32.1] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **MQTT "Test connection" no longer fails with "Not authorised" when the password field is left blank (#91).** The MQTT password field is masked — it shows `••••••••` but never carries the real value — so clicking *Test connection* without re-typing the password tested with an **empty** password and the broker rejected it as "Not authorised", even though the background MQTT bridge and the top-right status dot (both using the **saved** password) stayed green. *Test connection* now falls back to the saved password when the field is left empty, exactly like Save and the status indicator already do; if you type a new password it still tests that one, so verifying new credentials before saving keeps working.

## [1.32.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Saved wallbox profiles.** If you charge in more than one place — e.g. two homes, each with its own wallbox — you can now save a wallbox configuration (the Home Assistant connection, the entity mapping **and** the electricity tariff) under a name and switch between them in one click from **Settings → Wallbox**, instead of re-entering everything each time. The active profile is shown on the **Costs** page; switching is **blocked while a charge is in progress** so a session is never split across two wallboxes, and the per-profile **tariff travels with the profile** so each home's costs stay correct. Community feature contributed by **@domevite** (#84).

## [1.31.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Polish language (Polski). 🇵🇱** The whole UI is now available in Polish — the app, the settings **and** the first-run setup wizard — selectable in **Settings → Language**, or auto-detected from the browser on first launch. Dates use Polish month names, and the **złoty (zł)** is available as the display currency. Community translation contributed by **@irek** (#90), completed with the latest v1.30.0 strings, the setup wizard, Polish month names and `lang_pl` in every language, and normalised to the repo's line endings.

## [1.30.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Add a past charge by hand.** A new **➕ Add a past charge** form on the Charges page lets you backfill charging sessions from before you started using Mate, so the lifetime totals and the monthly report are complete. You enter just the date, energy (kWh), optional cost and AC/DC — manual entries carry no SoC or power curve, so they're excluded from the Battery-Health estimate and never have their cost overwritten by the automatic coster. (Requested by twiktorowicz, #87.)

### Changed
- **Statistics trend charts are now per **day**, not per trip.** The distance / efficiency / regen mini-charts under each month aggregate by day, so a handful of short hops no longer crowds the axis or spikes the efficiency line — the trend is far easier to read. (Suggested by riri19, #86.)
- **Vampire-drain chart gets two view toggles + a duration filter.** You can switch the bars between **%/day** (the normalised rate) and **% lost** (the actual SoC dropped during the stop), and between **per stop** and **per day** (one aggregated bar per calendar day) — so short parks no longer show alarming extrapolated spikes. A new Advanced setting, **minimum parking time**, hides parked stretches shorter than the chosen number of hours. (Suggested by riri19, #88.)
- **"Best efficiency" now ignores tiny trips.** The headline best-efficiency figure only considers trips of at least 15 km, so a short downhill coast or a glitchy frame can't masquerade as your record. (Suggested by riri19, #86.)

## [1.29.3] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Command feedback on the Prepare Car page.** Sending an immediate preparation or saving/deleting a schedule gave no on-screen feedback, so it wasn't clear whether the command had been sent, was waiting for the car, or hadn't fired at all (the cloud round-trip can take many seconds). Each of these now shows a **⏳ "Sending…" / "Saving…"** indicator the moment you submit, which stays until the car responds and is then replaced by the ✓/✗ result — matching the rest of the app.
- **"Charging" status label no longer looks stuck on.** On the Charges page the live panel's heading always read "Charging" (a section title in English), which in other languages reads as the live state — so it looked like the car was always charging even when the panel's own badge correctly said "Not charging". The heading is now a neutral **"Charging status"**; the real state is shown only by the badge. (Reported by riri19, #85.)

### Added
- **Delete account / Factory reset.** Settings now has a destructive **🗑️ Delete account / Reset** action (next to Log out) that wipes *everything* — the account, all trips, charges, positions and every setting (MQTT / wallbox / prices / Home Assistant) — and reopens the setup wizard as a brand-new install. Unlike **Log out** (which keeps your history, keyed to the car), this keeps nothing except the app-level certificate on disk, so re-onboarding still needs only your e-mail, password and PIN. It is **type-to-confirm** (you must type `RESET`) because it cannot be undone.

### Fixed
- **Onboarding no longer gets stuck after linking a freshly-shared car.** Right after a shared car is accepted, the Leapmotor cloud can briefly reject requests with a transient "verification failed, try again later" error until the share propagates. Two things handled that badly: the poller's **first login** let the error crash the process, which then restarted in a tight loop that hammered the cloud; and the **car picture** could be saved as the error response itself, leaving the Overview with no image until a manual refresh. The first login now **retries in-process with a backoff** (and picks up a corrected login at once) instead of restart-looping, and the car-picture download is now **validated as a real image** before it is cached. Both recover on their own.

### Changed
- **Comfort card laid out in two columns** on the Commands page (was three) — larger, easier-to-read seat / steering / mirror tiles.

## [1.29.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **Window remote-control on the C10 and B05.** cmd 230 now maps the uniform 0–100% slider onto their native 0–10 range and snaps to the steps the car actually actuates (0/20/50/100%), matching the B10. The C10 scale was confirmed on-car (thanks @kerniger / leapmotor-ha, discussion #47); the B05 shares the B10 platform and battery pack. Previously both models fell back to the 0–100 default, so any slider or vent value above ~10% was silently ignored by the car.

## [1.29.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Mobile-friendly Trips / Charges / Statistics, and quicker navigation.** On phones (< 640 px) the summary "hero" tiles now **stack vertically** so labels like *Total distance* / *Total trips* are no longer truncated — the tablet/desktop layout is unchanged. Each of the three pages gains a **"Collapse all"** button that folds the whole year/month tree in one click, and every open year/month row gets an inline **⊟** to collapse just that section; the open/closed state is remembered across reloads. A floating **back-to-top** button (↑) now appears on every page once you scroll down. (Thanks @hubcasale — #83.)

## [1.28.1] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **Charges now state which energy figure they show.** When Mate has no wallbox reading for a home charge it shows the energy that reached the battery — but that number used to appear with no label, so it could be mistaken for the higher "billed" (grid) amount. Each charge's energy now says what it is: **🔋 In battery (DC)** (what actually entered the battery) or **🔌 wallbox (billed)** (what the wallbox drew from the grid — what you pay). A tooltip on the battery figure explains it is ~10–15% lower than the grid draw, because of AC→DC conversion losses. (Reported by riri19, #80.)

## [1.28.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Climate panel — fan, recirculation and per-mode manual control.** Mate now reads three more things from the car and lets you set them. It reads the **fan level** (1–7), **air recirculation** (fresh air / recirculate) and the **active climate mode** (AUTO · Cool · Heat · Vent), shows them on the Vehicle card, and publishes them to Home Assistant over MQTT Discovery — a **writable `Fan Level` number**, a **writable `Recirculation` switch**, and a **`Climate Mode` sensor**. On the Commands page the climate card gains a **temperature slider, a fan slider and a recirculation toggle**: in the three manual modes (**Cool · Heat · Vent**) you can set the target temperature and the fan speed and the car **stays in that mode and remembers the value**; in **AUTO** the car manages fan and recirculation itself, so those two controls show the current value but stay read-only (the temperature remains adjustable as the AUTO target). Each climate tile (A/C AUTO · Cool · Heat · Vent · Defrost) now lights from the car's **real mode**, so exactly one is lit at a time and it matches the official app. Discovered and validated entirely by on-car testing on a B10 — including correcting the Leapmotor library, which mislabels the fan-level signal.

### Fixed
- **Rapid Ventilation now actually engages.** Pressing **Ventilazione Rapida** used to leave the car on whatever mode was already active unless you started from a neutral state; it now reliably switches the car into **true ventilation** (air only — no heating, no cooling) from **any** state, exactly like the official app.
- **No more slider "snap-back".** Moving the temperature or fan slider could briefly jump back to the old value before the car caught up — the value you set now stays put while the car re-polls within a few seconds.

## [1.27.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **V2L (vehicle-to-load) monitoring — a first for any Leapmotor tool.** When the car powers an external device through the V2L adapter, Mate now shows it. The Overview gets a live **V2L block** (status, instantaneous **net power** in watts with a 0–3500 W bar, and energy drawn this session) that refreshes every **10 s** while a session is running; the Statistics page gets a **Total V2L** card with the cumulative energy drawn over all time; and **three MQTT entities** are published to Home Assistant — **`V2L Active`** (binary), **`V2L Power`** (W) and **`V2L Session Energy`** (Wh). Power is reported **net of the car's own ~300 W overhead** (the idle baseline frozen when V2L starts), so it matches what your device actually draws — not the gross battery output. It's **read-only** (V2L can't be triggered remotely: the car needs Park + a connected device). Discovered entirely by on-car testing — the car reports V2L on the battery current/voltage signals plus an AC-port flag, with an honest resolution floor of **~42 W** (the car's own 0.1 A current resolution, so a 10 W phone charger stays invisible). While V2L is active the poller drops to a **10 s** cadence so power changes aren't missed, and V2L discharge is **excluded from the parked "vampire drain"** metric so a session powering a fridge never reads as battery loss.

### Fixed
- **The registration / delivery date on the Maintenance page can now be corrected.** Once set, it used to become read-only text with no way to fix a typo; it's now an editable field — click **✏️** next to the date to change it (the new value overwrites the old one).

## [1.26.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **The charge limit (target SoC) is now a writable Home Assistant entity.** A **`Charge Limit` `number`** (50–100 %) is published over MQTT Discovery: it shows the limit Mate already reads from the car and lets you set it straight from Home Assistant dashboards and automations — not only from Mate's Prepare-Car page. It reuses the same `set_charge_limit` command the web UI has always used, so there's no new car behaviour to trust. (Community request, #77.)

## [1.25.2] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **Running the standalone Docker image no longer dead-ends — the UI is reachable, data persists, and "Try the demo" works without a restart policy.** Three rough edges that hit anyone running the published image directly (especially via Docker Desktop's **Run** button):
  - The image now declares **`EXPOSE 4000`**, so Docker Desktop's Run dialog pre-fills the port mapping instead of showing *"No ports exposed in this image"* (which left the UI unreachable).
  - It now declares **`VOLUME /data`**, so trips/charges/login persist in an anonymous volume even if you forget `-v ...:/data`, instead of vanishing with the container.
  - The data directory is now **created explicitly** at startup (it used to be created only as a side effect), with a clear error if `/data` isn't writable — no more cryptic *"unable to open database file"* crash on first boot.
- **In-app relaunches ("Try the demo" / "Exit demo" and the account switch) no longer need a container restart policy.** They used to rely on the orchestrator recreating the container; a plain `docker run` / Docker Desktop "Run" sets no restart policy, so pressing **"Try the demo"** stopped the container and looked like a crash. The entrypoint now relaunches Mate **in-process**, so the toggles work everywhere. (Home Assistant add-on and policy-managed setups are unaffected.)

### Changed
- Removed an unused leftover translation key (`cmd_wait_next`) in all four languages.

## [1.25.1] — 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Command feedback now shows only the car's REAL state — clearer and consistent across the Overview and the Commands page.** Pressing a control no longer optimistically guesses the outcome: the tile you pressed shows a **"⏳ command in progress"** message until the car actually confirms the new state, every control is briefly disabled while a command completes so you can't fire a second one before the first is accepted (no more "not sent — retry in Ns" surprises), and the Commands grid now refreshes **live** so what you see always tracks the car. The same mechanism covers the Overview hero quick-commands and the whole Commands grid — vehicle (lock / trunk / windows / sunshade), climate, comfort toggles (steering & mirror heat) and the seat-level sliders — in EN/IT/FR/DE.

### Fixed
- **B10: a non-binary window status flag (e.g. `2`) is read as OPEN.** Confirmed live against the official app on a B10 — `2` is a genuinely open window. This reverts the 1.24.1 reading (which treated `2` as closed, from what turned out to be a stale cloud frame); transient/stale frames are now handled by the real-state polling above rather than by re-interpreting the flag.
- **Web log lines — and the Diagnostics bundle — are no longer doubled.** `uvicorn.run("main:app")` re-imports the app module a second time in the same process, so the rotating-file-log setup ran twice and attached two handlers to the same file: every web line was written twice, doubling both the log and the diagnostics export. The setup is now idempotent (the handler is added once); the poller was never affected. (Spotted in @riri19's diagnostics export.)

## [1.25.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Home Assistant: a single "Trunk" toggle ([#71](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/71), thanks @wlighter).** A new `switch` entity that shows the trunk's open/closed state **and** opens or closes it from one control — the trunk analog of the existing "Door Lock Toggle" (ON = open, OFF = closed). It reuses the `trunk_open` state and routes to the existing open/close commands; the separate Open/Close Trunk buttons stay for anyone already using them in automations.

### Fixed
- **Remote commands are no longer fired twice (and the session is no longer needlessly re-logged in) when the car doesn't confirm in time.** When a command timed out waiting for the car to acknowledge — the cloud accepted it (HTTP 200) but the car, parked and asleep, never confirmed — Mate misread the "timed out" message as a *network* error, reset the session (forcing a re-login) and **sent the command at the car a second time**. A car-confirm timeout is now recognised as exactly that: logged best-effort, with no reset, no re-login and no resend. Genuine connection errors still reset and retry as before. (Surfaced from @riri19's logs, [#73](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/73).)
- **Battery health: charges distorted by a BMS SoC recalibration or by active cabin use are now excluded from the capacity/SoH figure ([#72](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/pull/72), thanks @hubcasale).** Two cases produced artificially low capacity estimates: (1) the BMS occasionally snaps SoC upward without matching energy, inflating ΔSoC (detected on AC charges as a SoC rise > 0.8 %/min, ≈ 2× the physical AC ceiling); (2) the cabin A/C or heater running while plugged in feeds part of the charger energy to car loads instead of the battery (detected via climate cooling/heating during the session). Both are now excluded from the headline figure but still shown on the chart in amber for context, with per-reason labels and an explanatory note. The vampire-drain headline likewise excludes windows where the car was in active use (drain rate > 15 %/day). Four new strings in EN/IT/FR/DE.

## [1.24.2] — 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Home Assistant: "A/C Off" over MQTT now actually turns the climate off after a Quick Cool/Heat ([#67](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/67), thanks @Gr1m214).** The MQTT "A/C Off" button is guarded so that pressing it when the climate is already off is a harmless no-op. That guard read a reference (`last_climate_on`) that was only ever updated by a *poll* — the optimistic state published right after a command didn't update it. So immediately after a Quick Cool/Heat (before the next poll caught up) the reference still said "off", and the following "A/C Off" was **silently skipped**. The guard now stays in sync with the optimistic state, so "A/C Off" fires as expected. The web "A/C Off" button was never affected (it sends the command directly, without that guard). Verified end-to-end on a B10: Quick Cool → A/C on → A/C Off → A/C off. _Note: `ac_switch operate=off` is confirmed to fully switch the A/C off on the B10; on other models the cloud may accept but ignore it — a separate, model-level limit._

## [1.24.1] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **B10: windows no longer shown open when they are shut ([#68](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/68), thanks @riri19).** Some B10 firmware reports the window status flag with a non-binary value (e.g. `2`) on a *fully closed* window, while the actual opening position reads 0%. Mate treated any non-zero flag as "open", so the Overview tile, the Commands grid and the new live car image all showed a window — and the "windows open" count — open when it wasn't, and a *close windows* command couldn't self-confirm (it timed out and reverted). Mate now trusts the opening position when the car reports it (0% = shut) and treats only the canonical flag value as open, so a closed window reads closed everywhere. The T03 (position-driven) and the genuinely-open cases are unchanged.

## [1.24.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **The Overview car picture is now live.** Instead of a single static render, Mate composes the car image from the per-vehicle layer package it already downloads — so it reflects the real state: the **charge cable** (animated while charging), the **four doors**, the **two near-side windows**, and the **tailgate**. It updates the moment the state changes (and right after a command), and falls back to the static render if anything is unavailable. The interactive **demo** shows it too (charging animation out of the box). The model and colour come from the car's own package, so it works for any model.

### Changed
- **Unified colour system across Overview, Commands and Vehicle ([#66](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/66), thanks @riri19).** One consistent meaning for every colour so the eye can read state at a glance: **green = safe** (locked, closed), **amber = attention** (windows open), **red = alert** (trunk open, unlocked); **blue = cold** and **orange = hot** for climate and comfort; **teal** for non-critical/brand (sunroof shade, charts); and a **neutral grey** for any control at rest (no more "rainbow" of per-button colours). The Overview gained a **"trunk open" chip**, and the battery standby chart now uses the brand colour. State is shown by which control is highlighted plus the status chips — the action buttons stay neutral.

## [1.23.1] — 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **T03: the Overview tile and the Commands page now show the windows open (with the count) — not just the Vehicle page.** The window open/closed state was computed in several places, but only the Vehicle page had the 1.22.6 T03 fix. The Overview "windows" chip (and its open-count badge), the Commands grid and the post-command verification still read only the open/closed flags — which the T03 leaves at 0 even when the windows are open — so they kept showing "closed", and "open windows" never self-confirmed (it timed out after ~30s and reverted the optimistic state). All four surfaces now share a single position-aware reader, so they agree and the **"windows open" count** is correct on the T03 too. The B10 is unaffected: it reports no window position at all, so it stays flag-driven exactly as before. (#62)
- **Overview hero card: quick-command feedback is now immediate.** Pressing a quick command (lock/unlock, trunk, windows) on the car card only updated the visible state on the next 30-second auto-refresh, so it looked like nothing had happened and you couldn't tell whether the command had worked. The card now refreshes right after a command — an instant flip from the optimistic state, then it reconciles with the car as the cloud catches up (the same behaviour the Commands page already had). The window-open count flips with it.

## [1.23.0] — 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Window position control + per-window opening %** ([#62](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/62)). The Commands page now has a position slider for the windows, next to the quick "vent" button. It snaps to the stops each model actually actuates — the **B10** opens to 4 discrete positions (closed / ~20% vent / ~50% / fully open; it uses a 0–10 scale and ignores everything else, confirmed on-car), while the **T03** is continuous 0–100%. Opening asks for confirmation like the buttons, the slider reflects the last commanded position, and it triggers a fast status refresh so the change shows immediately.
- **The Vehicle page now shows each window's opening %.** The real value on cars that report it (T03), and the last commanded position on cars whose window-position sensor is dead (B10) — shown only for windows the open/closed flag confirms open, so a closed window never shows a stale number.

## [1.22.6] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **T03: the window open/closed status now reflects reality, and "open windows" works.** On the T03 the Vehicle page always showed the windows as "closed" — it read only the open/closed flags, which the T03 doesn't drive (it reports the live window *position* instead) — and the "open windows" button did nothing, because the command value the T03 needs differs from the B10's. Mate now also reads the window position where it's a reliable signal for the car (gated per-car via the capability profile, so the B10's dead position-sensor can't produce false "open" readings), and sends the model-appropriate open value. The B10 is unaffected (same command, same behaviour as before). (#62)

## [1.22.5] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **No more spurious "Could not find the TLS certificate file" errors and unnecessary re-logins.** The per-login account TLS certificate can be cleaned up mid-session — most visibly on a car with weak mobile coverage that fails many polls — which used to surface as an alarming error and force a full re-login. Mate now re-creates the certificate in place from the copy it already keeps (before each status poll and each remote command), so the session keeps working without a re-login (#64). Note: commands to a parked car on a weak signal or in deep sleep can still time out — that's the car not answering, not a Mate error, and the **Car responsiveness** indicator on the Overview reflects it.

## [1.22.4] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **The battery-standby (vampire-drain) chart no longer looks empty when your display threshold hides every window.** The Advanced "minimum drop" setting is a *display* threshold — raising it above your car's actual standby losses used to blank the whole section with a "no measurable drain" message, making it look as if the history had been lost (#63). Now the typical-rate headline always shows while measurable parked windows exist; the chart adds a "+N below your threshold" note when it hides smaller windows; and when every window is below the threshold the page says so explicitly and points you to lower the slider in **Settings → Advanced**, instead of looking empty.

### Changed
- **Diagnostics bundle now reports the vampire-drain display threshold and reproduces the page.** The computed section uses the same `vampire_min_drop_pct` the battery page does (so a high threshold shows `count=0` here too, with the measurable-window count revealing the real cause), and the header prints the threshold value.

## [1.22.3] — 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Diagnostics bundle now shows the computed battery-standby (vampire-drain) result and a 14-day SoC-by-day summary.** When someone reports an empty or missing battery-drain chart, the downloaded bundle now includes exactly what Mate computes — the window count, the time-weighted rate and each detected window — plus, for the last 14 days, the daily battery-% high→low and the km driven. That makes the actual cause (sparse data, no qualifying parked period, gaps, etc.) visible at a glance instead of guessing from a screenshot.

## [1.22.2] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Vampire-drain chart now captures standby loss that only becomes visible when the car wakes.** While a car is in deep sleep it stops reporting and the cloud serves a *frozen* battery %, so a slow standby loss stays invisible — and if you drove off right after waking, that drop fell in the gap between the last parked reading and the trip's start, and was never counted as standby drain (so the chart could look empty). Mate now closes the parked window at the fresh battery % from the wake-into-drive reading, attributing the loss correctly. Charging wake-ups are left out (the pre-charge gap is ambiguous), and the existing reliability flag still marks short/high-rate windows as estimates.

## [1.22.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **The Overview map no longer disappears when the car reports no GPS fix.** Parked or in standby, the car can answer a poll with no position — coordinates come through as `0, 0` — and the Overview's "Last position" map was then hidden until the next valid fix. Mate now falls back to the **last known valid position**, so the map keeps showing where the car was last seen (this also gives the Navigation page a sensible starting point instead of a default).

## [1.22.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Maintenance page.** A new section that tracks your car's factory service schedule, taken from the official owner's manual for your exact model (T03, B05, B10, C10) — never another model's, so each car shows only its own programme. Mate computes what's **overdue / due soon / up to date** from the live odometer and the time since delivery, with a distance bar and a time bar (whichever comes first wins). For a brand‑new car with no history it shows the **first‑service due** from your delivery date; you log each service (date + km) as it's done and the schedule rolls forward. Distances follow your unit setting (km or miles) and the whole page is translated (EN/IT/FR/DE). *(B05 inherits the validated B10 schedule provisionally until its own manual is published; range‑extender/REEV models are out of scope — Mate is BEV‑only.)*

### Changed
- **Diagnostics bundle is richer and easier to share.** "Download diagnostics" now also bundles the car's **raw signals** — with your GPS coordinates stripped — so reporting a model‑specific issue no longer needs any copy‑paste: one click attaches everything, and it stays safe to share publicly. The bundle header also shows the **position‑data span and retention setting**, which makes "my history looks empty" reports (e.g. an empty battery‑health or vampire‑drain chart) diagnosable at a glance. The separate on‑screen "raw signals" view — which showed your live GPS — was removed in favour of this redacted download.

## [1.21.7] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Front-seat heat/vent tiles are labelled "Driver / Passenger" again, not "Left / Right".** The per-seat comfort *command* is role-based — Mate sends `driver`/`co-driver` and the car maps the role to the physical side for its market — so the fixed "Left/Right" labels introduced in v1.14.0 were inverted on right-hand-drive (UK) cars: turning on "Right seat" actuated the seat the official app shows on the **left** ([#61](https://github.com/ProtossBlaster/leapmotor-mate/issues/61)). Restored the role labels across the Commands tiles, the one-touch Prepare-car screen and the MQTT entities (object_ids unchanged → no Home Assistant churn), so Mate now matches the official app on both LHD and RHD. **Doors, windows, tyres and mirrors are unaffected** — those are physical-position signals (e.g. doors come from the left/right body-control modules) and correctly stay Left/Right.

## [1.21.6] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **"Car responsiveness" indicator on the Overview.** A small coloured dot next to the status card shows how reliably your car has been answering remote commands lately — a proxy for the mobile coverage where it's parked (🟢 good · 🟡 patchy · 🔴 poor · ⚪ no data yet). It's built from the outcome of your **last 24 commands** — only "car confirmed in time" vs "car didn't confirm" count, since a cloud/network or PIN error isn't the car's fault — and recovers to green within a handful of good commands. A poll only reads the cloud's *cached* state, so a command is the one moment Mate reaches the car in real time, which is exactly what this measures. Hover for details.

### Changed
- **Clearer message when a command "times out".** When you send a command and the Leapmotor cloud accepts it ("request successful") but the car doesn't confirm in time — typically weak cellular coverage or the car in deep standby — Mate now shows an **amber "sent — the car didn't confirm in time (it may still have worked); try again shortly"** notice instead of a red error. The command often *did* apply: it's the car's reachability, not a Mate fault. Genuine cloud-unreachable or auth/PIN errors still show clearly in red.

## [1.21.5] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **No more negative "best efficiency" in Statistics.** A trip recorded with the SoC *rising* (e.g. a trip window mis‑bounded across a charge during an offline gap) produced a negative efficiency, which surfaced as a nonsensical "best efficiency" like −39 kWh/100km. Mate now never stores or displays a negative efficiency (the trip‑finalize/repair paths withhold it, and a one‑time cleanup nulls any already recorded), so the best/average figures stay real.

### Changed
- **Clearer "dedicated account" guidance.** The Leapmotor account Mate uses must be **exclusive to Mate** — never signed into another app, add‑on, Docker container or integration at the same time. Leapmotor allows only ~one active session per account, so concurrent clients evict each other's session, the car goes offline, and you get **missing or inconsistent data**. This is now spelled out in the setup wizard, the README and the Docker Hub page.

## [1.21.4] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **No more phantom "charged from 0%" charges (and false "Recover missed charges" results).** Once in a
  while the car answers a poll without its battery‑% (SoC) field — often a read perturbed by a command
  you just sent (e.g. changing the charge limit). Mate read that missing value as **0%**, so both the
  live detection and the **Recover missed charges** scan could invent a charge "from 0% to your current
  level" (tens of kWh that never happened). Three‑layer fix: a poll with no usable SoC (or SoC 0% while
  the car still reports range) is now treated as *no live data* and skipped at the source; a
  reconstructed or scanned charge whose implied power is physically impossible (a full pack "charged" in
  seconds) is rejected; and a one‑time cleanup removes any phantom charges already recorded plus the
  bogus 0% data points behind them. Real charges that happened while the car was asleep are still
  reconstructed as before.

## [1.21.3] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Overview charge ETA now shows the real charge limit, not a hardcoded 100%.** While charging, the
  hero card read e.g. *"3h 00m al 100%"* even when the car's charge limit was set to 90% — the target
  percentage was a fixed string. It now shows the **actual configured limit** the car reports
  (*"… al 90%"*, the same value as the Charges page "Charge Limit"). The car already reports both the
  remaining time and the SoC it will stop at — only the label was wrong. The limit is captured by the
  poller from each status read (free — it's in the same response; updates even if you change it from the
  official app) and persisted, and is mirrored immediately when you set it from Mate. Localised IT/EN/FR/DE.
- **Charging animation no longer overlaps the car image.** The plug → flow → battery animation was
  absolutely positioned over the car picture, so on every screen the icons sat on top of the vehicle
  (wheels/body), and in the narrow 3‑column layout (~1024px, e.g. a slim Home Assistant panel) the
  status pill wrapped and split *"al 90%"* across two lines. The animation now sits **below** the car in
  normal flow — it can't overlap the vehicle at any resolution — and the charging pill stays on **one
  line** at every width (verified 320 → 1280px).

## [1.21.2] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Manual charge cost — enter what you actually paid.** Public charging is a jungle (flat
  subscriptions, per‑plan Ionity rates, Tesla's monthly fee + time‑of‑use pricing, session/idle fees…)
  and the bill often isn't a clean €/kWh — so a per‑kWh tariff can't model it. A charge's type selector
  now has a 5th option, **✎ Manual**: pick it and type the **real total paid**; it **overrides** Mate's
  table estimate. The effective **€/kWh** (cost ÷ the charge's energy) is shown on the card and feeds
  the trip cost / weighted‑average‑cost (WAC) **exactly like any priced charge** — so the next trip is
  priced from what you really paid. A manual cost is **protected**: the auto‑Home confirm and the
  one‑time energy/cost repairs never overwrite it (the repairs may still refine the *energy*, which only
  sharpens the manual €/kWh). Accepts a comma decimal (`18,45`).
- **Effective €/kWh on every charge card** — each session now shows its real rate (cost ÷ energy) under
  the cost, so you can see at a glance what each charge actually cost per kWh.

> Implements the cost‑precision half of the request in #56. Payment‑method tagging / per‑method spend
> breakdowns stay **out of scope** for Mate (telemetry‑derived cost is in; payment/billing tracking is
> not — as decided in #17).

## [1.21.1] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Try the demo from inside Mate — no command line needed.** The setup screen now opens on a simple
  choice — **"Set up my car"** or **"Try the demo"**. Picking the demo turns it on and restarts straight
  into it; an amber banner at the top of every page lets you leave again (*"Exit demo & set up my car"*).
  So a Home Assistant **add-on** user can explore the sample‑data demo with **one click**, instead of
  needing `-e MATE_DEMO=1` on the command line (which still works for standalone Docker). The in‑demo
  restart waits for the container to come back in the right mode before reloading, so it never hangs.
- **Overview — status‑aware quick‑command icons.** The lock / trunk / windows buttons on the car image
  now mirror the live state: **unlocked** highlights amber, **locked** highlights green, an **open trunk
  turns red**, **open windows** highlight violet — the car's state is readable at a glance.
- **Overview — "cable connected / charge complete" state.** When a charge finishes (or pauses) with the
  cable still plugged in, the car no longer just reads *"Parked"*: it shows **"Cable connected · NN%"** on
  the car image (with the plug icon) plus a **"Charge complete"** status, in the teal charge colour. The
  percentage is the real battery SoC; unplugging the cable returns to the normal parked view.

### Changed
- The setup screen leads with the car/demo choice; the Leapmotor account login and the app‑certificate
  step now appear only **after** choosing *"Set up my car"* (with a **Back** link). The in‑app logo now
  uses Mate's car icon — matching the Docker/add‑on icon — instead of the old "LM" placeholder.

### Security
- **Never bundle the app TLS certificate in the image.** The shared app cert (`certs/app.crt` / `app.key`,
  provided by the user at setup) was already git‑ignored and **absent from the published image**, but a
  *local* `docker build` from a working dir that had the files would have copied them in. They're now in
  `.dockerignore` as well, so a local build can never accidentally bundle them.

## [1.21.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Demo mode — try Mate before configuring anything.** Run Mate with `MATE_DEMO=1`
  (e.g. `docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 -e MATE_DEMO=1 ghcr.io/protossblaster/leapmotor-mate`) and it serves
  a realistic, self‑contained **month of sample data** — weekday commutes, cheap overnight home AC charging,
  a *weekend al mare* with an expensive **DC fast charge**, the blended (WAC) trip costs, battery health,
  vampire drain and the monthly report — with **no Leapmotor account, car or cloud**. Remote commands are
  **simulated** (lock, climate, windows… flip the demo's own state), so the whole UI is explorable and
  interactive, and a **DEMO** badge is shown. **All data is purely demonstrative — nothing is real.**
  Fully gated behind `MATE_DEMO`: a normal install is unaffected (the demo code is inert when the flag is
  off — verified by the full test suite running in normal mode).

## [1.20.2] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Remote commands no longer get stuck on "Token is invalid" after heavy use.** The account
  TLS certificate Leapmotor issues at login is a short‑lived temp file; once it got cleaned up,
  the poller and the web process could no longer reuse the shared session and re‑logged in on
  **every cycle** — a login storm the Leapmotor cloud then throttled ("Information verification
  failed, please try again later"), so remote commands failed with *Token is invalid*. Mate now
  copies that certificate to a stable file and can re‑create it from the saved session, so the
  shared session survives a vanished temp file and the re‑login storm is gone. (Reported by
  @riri19, #54. Note: the Leapmotor cloud also needs at least ~10 s between remote commands.)

## [1.20.1] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Leapmotor B05 battery capacities.** The new B05 hatchback (2026) is now recognised at setup with its
  two European variants — **55.0 kWh usable** (Pro · 401 km WLTP) and **65.0 kWh usable** (Pro Max · 482 km
  WLTP) — instead of falling back to a generic default. The B05 shares the B10's battery pack, so the figures
  match. Affects new setups and the capacity used for energy/efficiency and battery‑health estimates;
  existing installs keep whatever they already configured.

## [1.20.0] — 2026-06-13

### Changed
- **Trip cost is now based on the _blended_ price of the energy actually in your battery
  (weighted‑average cost), not the price of your single last charge.** This fixes a real
  over‑billing on mixed charging: previously, right after a small expensive public/HPC charge,
  **every** following trip was billed at that premium rate — even though most of the energy still in
  the battery came from a cheaper home charge. Now each charge blends into a running average by **how
  much energy it added**, and a trip is priced at that blend. *Example:* a full home charge at
  €0.25/kWh, then a 20 kWh HPC top‑up at €0.75/kWh, leaves the pack at a blended **€0.42/kWh** (not
  €0.75) — so a 20 kWh trip reads **€8.33**, not €15.00. _(Suggested by @riri19, #53; builds on the
  #51 billed‑energy fix.)_

  **How trip costs are calculated from now on — please read, so the numbers make sense:**
  - **A per‑trip cost is an estimate, not an invoice.** You pay at the charger, not per trip, so Mate
    _allocates_ your charging spend across trips. The trip costs will normally sum to a bit **less**
    than what you actually paid: some energy goes to climate, standby (vampire) drain, charging losses
    and regen. **That gap is expected — not a bug.**
  - **The price only moves when you charge** (never while driving): at each charge, new blended €/kWh =
    `(kWh still in the pack × old price + kWh added × this charge's price) ÷ total kWh`.
  - **A public charge counts only once you confirm its cost** on the Charges page (home charges are
    priced automatically). Until you confirm it, your trips keep the previous price and then update by
    themselves the moment you confirm it.
  - **The trip's energy (kWh) is still estimated from the battery %**, so very short or sparsely‑polled
    trips can still read rough. A more precise energy method (from pack voltage × current) is planned
    (#52).
  - The new figure can come out **higher _or_ lower** than before depending on your charge mix — that's
    it being more accurate, not a regression.
- **Overview layout tidied** — the vehicle card and the "last known position" map swapped places for a
  cleaner flow.

### Added
- **Redesigned vehicle card on the Overview.** The car photo now doubles as a live panel: **doors
  locked/unlocked** and **open‑windows count** overlaid on the image, **quick command buttons**
  (unlock · lock · trunk · windows, colour‑coded) below it, and — while charging — an **animated energy
  flow** with live **kW · % · time‑to‑full**. It now falls back to a placeholder when the cloud photo
  isn't available, instead of the whole card disappearing.
- **"New section" badges in Settings.** When a future release adds a Settings section, it shows a
  **NEW** badge on its header until you open it once — so a new option isn't missed in the changelog.
  (No section is flagged in this release; the mechanism is ready for the next one.)

## [1.19.3] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **The account TLS certificate now survives restarts (root-cause fix for the vanishing cert).** At
  every login the API writes the account certificate and key as temporary files. They used to land in
  the container's **ephemeral `/tmp`**, which a standalone Docker install (e.g. on a NAS) wipes on
  every restart — so the two files vanished, remote commands failed with *"Could not find the TLS
  certificate file"*, and the poller had to re-login on each restart. They now live on the
  **persistent `/data`** volume (via `TMPDIR`), so they persist across restarts and the session is
  reused without a re-login. The v1.19.2 self-heal stays as a safety net. *(Reported by @riri19.)*

## [1.19.2] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Remote commands now recover from a missing TLS certificate.** On some setups the account's TLS
  certificate (a temporary file) gets cleaned out of `/tmp`, and a command would then fail outright
  with *"Could not find the TLS certificate file"*. Commands now treat this like any other auth
  hiccup — re-login (which re-creates the certificate) and retry — the same self-heal the background
  poller already had. *(Reported by @riri19.)*
- **Quieter command logs.** A command that fails once and succeeds on retry (a transient stale
  connection or an expired token) no longer logs an alarming `ERROR`; the error level is now reserved
  for a command that actually gives up.

## [1.19.1] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Trip starts no longer missed after the car sleeps.** When the car was parked and not reporting,
  the poller could back off to a fixed 15-minute cycle and only notice a drive well after it had begun
  (the first sample already at speed, the start of the route cut off). It now keeps polling at **your
  configured cadence** whenever the car or the cloud is briefly unreachable, so the start of a trip is
  caught as soon as data returns. Polling the cloud never wakes or drains the car, and re-login stays
  rate-limited. *(Diagnosed with @riri19, #52.)*
- **"Driving" shown while parked (Home Assistant / ABRP).** The published vehicle state was derived
  from a climate-fan signal, so a fan speed of 3–5 while parked could read as *driving*. It now comes
  from the **gear and speed** — the same inputs as trip detection — so the MQTT `state` sensor and the
  ABRP `is_parked` flag match reality. *(Reported by @riri19.)*
- **Crash-recovery trip distance.** Closing a trip left open by a restart now filters out null-island
  (0, 0) GPS fixes before measuring, so a single stray point can no longer inflate a trip's distance.

## [1.19.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- **📆 Monthly Report.** A new **Report** page brings one month of driving, charging and **cost**
  together at a glance: distance, trips, average efficiency and energy used; charging cost, sessions,
  energy charged and average €/kWh; a **Home vs public** split; cost per 100 km, regen and drive time;
  **deltas vs the previous month**; and **daily distance/cost charts**. Move between months with ◀ ▶
  or the dropdown, and see a **map of every trip that month**. The figures match the Statistics
  (driving) and Charges (cost) pages exactly.
- **🔒 Security indicator on the Overview.** The first card now shows a **Security** row (just above
  READY) — green **Active** when the car is locked and its alarm is armed — mirroring Leapmotor's own
  *vehicle security active* signal. *(Suggested by @riri19.)*
- **✅ "Fully charged" badge.** While the cable is still plugged in and the charge has completed, the
  Overview charging card shows a **Fully charged** badge.
- **Battery-health cold cutoff.** A new slider in **Settings → Advanced** sets the temperature below
  which cold charges are excluded from the State-of-Health estimate (a cold LFP pack reads low). Default
  15 °C; set it to 0 to include every charge.

### Fixed
- **Privacy of the shareable diagnostics bundle.** The exported diagnostics now also redact three things
  that could leak when a bundle is posted publicly: the remote-control **`operatePassword`** (it was
  printed in clear in the web log), the **VIN where it appears lowercase inside the Home Assistant MQTT
  discovery topic**, and **exact GPS coordinates** in the trip logs (truncated to ~10 km). The actual
  MQTT topic, the database and live logging are unchanged. *(Reported by @riri19.)*

## [1.18.1] — 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **Trip cost on a wallbox install.** A trip's cost is derived from the €/kWh of the last
  charge before it. That rate divided the charge's cost by the **battery (DC/SoC) energy**, but
  HOME charges are billed on the (larger) **wallbox AC energy** — so the rate, and every trip's
  cost, was overstated by the charging losses (and by more when a charge ended near 100%). It now
  divides by the **same energy the cost was billed on** (AC for HOME, battery otherwise), so a
  trip's €/kWh matches your real tariff. *(Reported by @riri19, #51.)*

## [1.18.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **📍 Charging-station names on charges** *(opt-in)*. Every public charge is tagged automatically
  with the name of the station it happened at — shown as **📍 Station name** on the Charges list and
  on the Overview "last charge" card. The lookup runs in the background, fills in already-recorded
  charges too, and **never looks up home charges**. Enable it in **Settings → Charging stations**
  *(off by default)*. *(Idea: @hubcasale, PR #48 — reimplemented Mate-side over multiple sources.)*
- **⚡ Find charging stations** on the **Navigation** page. A new button maps the public chargers
  around the car: choose the **max distance** and **results per page**, filter **by operator**
  (e.g. Electra, Ionity), and see **AC/DC, power (kW) and live availability** — as map pins and a
  list underneath. Tap a station to set it as your destination and send it to the car's navigator.
- **Multi-source charger search**, with cross-source de-duplication: **OpenStreetMap** and the
  **Italian national registry (PUN)** — both keyless and always on — plus **Open Charge Map** and
  **TomTom** when you add their free API keys *(Settings → Charging stations)*. More sources, better
  coverage; live availability comes from the PUN where available.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **🎨 Mate has its own face.** New app icon (a car on a telemetry pulse, in the UI's teal) shown in
  the sidebar and mobile header as "LeapMotor **Mate**", plus a **browser-tab favicon** (there was
  none). The same icon now identifies the Home Assistant add-on in the store. The official Leapmotor
  wordmark is no longer used inside the app — Mate is an unofficial companion and now looks the part.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **🏠 Auto-assign "Home" to wallbox charges** *(opt-in)*. New toggle in **Settings → Wallbox**:
  charges where your wallbox measured energy are confirmed as **Home** automatically — if *your*
  wallbox saw the energy flow, the charge happened at home. The cost goes through the **same engine
  as a manual confirm**, so flat prices **and time-of-use bands** (including the accurate split
  across band changes) come out identical to tapping the badge yourself — verified on real charges.
  Turning the toggle on also confirms the eligible charges already in your history and tells you how
  many. DC/public charges, reconstructed ones and anything you already typed are never touched, and
  you can still change the type by hand afterwards. Off by default.
  *(Idea: @hubcasale, PR #47 — thank you!)*

## [1.16.14] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- **⚡ Faster add-on installs & updates.** The Home Assistant add-on now installs a **prebuilt
  image** instead of compiling on your device, so installs and updates are much quicker and lighter
  on the hardware. No action needed — your data and settings are kept across the switch. (This also
  clears two deprecation notices the Supervisor was logging about the old build files.)

## [1.16.13] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **🔌 Impossible charge energy & cost fixed.** A wallbox energy counter that reads ~0 when you plug
  in and then snaps back to its **lifetime total** could log a single charge as tens of thousands of
  kWh — with a matching three‑figure cost — throwing off your charge totals. Mate now rejects a
  physically impossible counter jump, keeps counting the **real** energy after it, and a **one‑time
  cleanup** repairs any such charge already in your history: it drops the bogus wallbox figure and
  re‑prices the charge on the battery (SoC) energy at the same €/kWh. Genuine charges are never
  touched (verified on real data). *(GitHub #46.)*

## [1.16.12] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **🔌 No more phantom charges.** A brief plug / charge‑state blip — e.g. the car re‑evaluating after
  you change a charge **schedule** — could leave a fake "charge" in the log that gained no SoC and
  delivered no energy. These empty sessions are now dropped on the spot, and a **one‑time cleanup**
  removes any already in your history. Strictly empty‑only: a charge with **any** SoC gain **or any**
  wallbox‑measured energy is never touched (verified on real data). *(Reported on Telegram.)*

### Changed
- **⏱️ Charge & trip durations read as hours.** A long session now shows **10h 19m** instead of a bare
  *619 min* — in the Overview "last charge" card, the Charges and Trips lists, and the trip detail.

## [1.16.11] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **🎛️ Wallbox picker no longer floods with home power sensors.** On a charger surrounded by lots
  of home‑energy sensors (e.g. a V2C/Trydan with whole‑home monitoring), the role dropdowns could
  list *every* `power` entity in the house. The device filter now anchors on the **power + energy**
  roles (the ones auto‑detection nails reliably), so a secondary role that mapped off‑device — e.g. a
  max‑current control falling back to a household `number` — can no longer collapse the narrowing;
  each dropdown again shows only the wallbox's own sensors. *(Reported on Telegram.)*

## [1.16.10] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- **🔋 Sharper Battery health (SoH) trend.** The state‑of‑health estimate no longer follows the
  seasons: **cold charges are shown but excluded** from the figure (an LFP pack reads low when cold,
  so a winter session isn't real ageing — threshold configurable via `soh_temp_min_c`, default 15 °C),
  and **charges that end near 100% weigh the most** (the BMS recalibrates the SoC there, so their SoC
  delta — and the estimate — is the most trustworthy). The trend chart gains a **Time / Distance
  toggle** to separate calendar ageing from cycle (per‑km) ageing; each point now carries its battery
  temperature and odometer, and excluded points appear faded with the reason in the tooltip. The
  *Settings → "use measured" capacity* value benefits from the same cleaner estimate. EN/IT/FR/DE.

## [1.16.9] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **🔓 Log out / change Leapmotor account.** A new **Log out** button in *Settings → Vehicle* clears
  only the stored login and re‑opens the setup wizard so you can link a **different Leapmotor
  account** — without losing anything. Your trips, charges and positions are kept (they're tied to
  the car's VIN, so the same car carries straight over) and the shared app certificate is untouched.
  The poller re‑authenticates as the new account automatically. (Asks for confirmation first.)

### Changed
- **🗺️ Map tiles now load in privacy‑strict Firefox.** OpenStreetMap blocks tiles that arrive without
  a `Referer`, which some Firefox setups (strict tracking protection, private windows, hardened forks
  like LibreWolf/Mullvad) strip — so the map showed "Access blocked" tiles. The tile layers now send
  the page origin explicitly (`referrerPolicy`), fixing it on every map (Map, Overview, Trip detail,
  Navigation). Chrome was unaffected and stays the same.
- **🎛️ Wallbox sensor picker can't be mis‑mapped by unit.** Each role's dropdown now offers **only
  sensors of the right unit** for the two that feed the calculations — **Charging power** lists only
  kW, **Session energy** only kWh — so a kWh meter can no longer be mapped as power (or vice‑versa),
  which used to silently corrupt the stored power and cost data. A choice you already saved is never
  hidden, the other roles (whose unit varies by wallbox) stay unfiltered, and **Show all entities**
  bypasses it for non‑standard setups.
- **🏷️ Precise wallbox field names with units.** Every mapping field now states its unit — *Charging
  power (kW)*, *Session energy (kWh)*, *Charging speed (km/h)* — and the mislabeled current control is
  fixed from "Wallbox power control" to **Max charging current (A)** (it sets amps, not power). *Max
  available* is clarified as **kW or A** since V2C/Pulsar report it in amps. EN/IT/FR/DE.
- The *Vehicle* settings card now opens by default so the new Log out button is easy to find.

## [1.16.8] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- **🪗 The Settings page is now a tidy accordion.** Every section is collapsible (the same pattern as
  the old *Advanced* card) and **starts collapsed**, so instead of scrolling past long, always-open
  cards you get a clean list of titles and open only the one you need. Each card **remembers its
  open/collapsed state** (saved server-side, shared across devices), and the integration cards (ABRP,
  Wallbox, MQTT) show their **connection status right in the header** even while collapsed. Cards are
  balanced **5/4/4** across the three columns so the page no longer leaves big empty gaps.
  *(Suggested by a user on Telegram.)*

### Fixed
- The *Advanced* card now actually remembers whether you left it open — its key was missing from the
  save allowlist, so toggling it never persisted before.

## [1.16.7] — 2026-06-11

### Changed
- **🔌 Readable wallbox entity dropdowns.** Long Home Assistant entity names were truncated in the
  two-column mapping grid — and the truncated part was exactly the word that tells roles apart
  (*Voltage* / *Power* / *Energy*). The pickers are now **one per line** (full width), and **hovering
  shows the whole name** as a tooltip — both on each option in the open list and on the closed box,
  where it reflects the entity you've mapped (including its full `entity_id`, handy when two sensors
  look almost identical). *(Suggested by a user on Telegram.)*

## [1.16.6] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **🔌 Wallbox setup now explains itself (#44).** Every entity-mapping field has a short hint under it
  saying exactly what to pick — the *type* of Home Assistant entity (a `sensor`, or a `number` for the
  current control) and its *unit* — plus a line at the top explaining how auto-detection works and what to
  do if your charger isn't listed (tick "Show all", or add its name to the detection keywords). EN/IT/FR/DE.

### Fixed
- **🔍 V2C Trydan chargers are detected automatically (#44).** Added `v2c`/`trydan` to the detection
  keywords (matched on the entity id, which doesn't change with your HA language), so the picker fills in
  on its own. Solar and house-power sensors (e.g. "Energia fotovoltaica", "Alimentazione domestica",
  "Consumo appartamento") — which are also `power`/`energy` entities — are now kept out of the charging
  roles so they can't be mapped by mistake.

## [1.16.5] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **🦇 No more scary “9 %/day” vampire-drain bars (#41).** The chart normalises every parked window to
  %/day — so a single 0.1%-resolution SoC step over a short park got multiplied into a huge bar (a real
  case: −0.4% over 1.1 h → “9.1 %/day”, against a true error band of ±4.4). Short or still-running parks
  are still recorded, but now render as **pale bars** with the ± uncertainty in the tooltip and a “low
  confidence (short park)” note; the park still in progress is marked “still parked” with a “…” on its
  date. Long, trustworthy windows stay solid purple. *(The small drop itself is usually genuine: in the
  first hour after a drive the car hasn’t reached deep sleep yet — that’s a few hundred watts, briefly.
  It’s the ×22 extrapolation to a daily rate that was misleading.)*
- **📍 The map no longer drifts back into the sea for UK / west-of-Greenwich cars (#43).** The signed-sign
  fix from v1.15.0 (#30) is still in place, but some cars omit the signed coordinate in certain poll states
  (and a restart — e.g. an add-on update — forgot what it had learned), so Mate fell back to the *unsigned*
  value and a Lichfield car jumped out to the North Sea again. Mate now **remembers which hemisphere your
  car is in** and re-applies it whenever a poll sends only the unsigned coordinate — and it persists that
  across restarts. East-of-Greenwich cars are unaffected.

### Changed
- **The “typical idle drain” headline is now time-weighted** — total SoC lost ÷ total parked time, across
  *all* parks of at least an hour **including the ones that lost nothing** (which the old median quietly
  skipped, so it overstated drain: a real install read 1.9 %/day where the honest figure is 0.8). If the
  number drops after updating, that’s the correction — not a change in your car.
- **“Average efficiency” now means the same thing on every page (#42).** The Statistics overview showed a
  plain average of each trip’s efficiency, while the Trips page showed a distance-weighted one — so the
  same trips read e.g. 16.6 vs 19.1 kWh/100 km, and the Statistics figure didn’t even match its own
  “energy used ÷ distance”. Both pages now use the distance-weighted value (total energy ÷ total distance),
  which is the physically correct fleet average and what other EV apps report.

## [1.16.4] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **The “Delete trip” button actually deletes now.** It had never worked since it shipped (v1.13.0): its
  relative URL resolved against the app root, so the request went to a route that doesn’t exist and the
  button silently did nothing. If you've ever pressed it and the trip stubbornly stayed — that was this.
  Verified end-to-end, standalone and behind Home Assistant ingress.

## [1.16.3] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **🔘 “Door Lock Toggle” — a switch you can put on one button (#38).** Launcher widgets (like Samsung’s
  Home Assistant widget) force a *fixed* action on lock-type entities, so the Door Lock entity couldn’t
  work as a single lock/unlock button. There’s now also a **switch** entity (ON = locked): widgets *can*
  toggle a switch, so one tap locks, the next unlocks. The lock entity stays for dashboards. *(Validated
  end-to-end on a real MQTT broker.)*

### Removed
- **The separate Lock / Unlock buttons in Home Assistant** — fully redundant now that the Door Lock entity
  (state + both actions) and the Door Lock Toggle switch exist; they disappear automatically on update. If
  you had them on a dashboard, swap in **Door Lock**. Automations that publish the raw `lock` / `unlock`
  MQTT commands keep working unchanged.

### Fixed
- **🅿️ A few-metres manoeuvre is no longer logged as a “1 km” trip.** The odometer reads in whole km, so a
  short driveway shuffle that happened to cross a km boundary was recorded as a 1.0 km trip (a real case:
  24 m logged as 1 km). On that ambiguous reading Mate now cross-checks the GPS track and drops the phantom
  hop; a **one-time repair** corrects such historical trips to their real distance (nothing is deleted).
- **✋ Closing asks for confirmation too.** Boot, windows and roof shade asked “are you sure?” only when
  *opening*; closing fired immediately — but a remote close can pinch a hand (or just be an accidental
  tap). Both directions now confirm when parked; while driving you still go straight to the “vehicle in
  motion” notice.
- **📅 Dates in your language.** The recent-trips list and the trip page title now show “10 giu 2026” (or
  “10 Jun 2026”, “10 juin 2026”…) instead of the raw “2026-06-10”.
- **📱 No more giant wrapped text on phones.** The efficiency figure (“20 kWh/100km”) rendered whole at
  headline size, wrapping mid-value on the trip page and overflowing the Trips summary tile; it now shows
  a big number with a small unit, like every other stat. The trip-page date also stays on one line.

## [1.16.2] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **No more pointless “are you sure?” prompt when a control is blocked by motion.** Pressing lock / boot /
  windows / sunshade **while driving** used to ask for confirmation first and only *then* show the “vehicle
  in motion — disabled” notice. Now, while moving, the press goes straight to the notice. **Parked behaviour
  is unchanged** — those controls still ask for confirmation, so an accidental tap can’t open a parked car
  you’re not standing next to.

## [1.16.1] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Controls the car locks while moving no longer misbehave — sunshade, boot, windows and door-lock.**
  These can't be operated in motion (the official app shows the same notice), and the sunshade's state
  signal is unreliable at speed — which could make the **Panoramic Roof** tile briefly read *“closed”*
  while it was actually open. The Commands page now shows a **“car in motion” banner** over those controls
  while driving, and pressing one returns a clear **“Vehicle in motion — … disabled”** notice instead of
  firing a command the car would only reject. Climate and comfort controls are unaffected — they work
  while driving.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **⚙️ Advanced settings** (Settings → Advanced, collapsed by default). Three tunables for edge cases, with
  sane defaults and a Reset: the **missed-charge SoC threshold** (the battery-% jump that counts as a charge
  Mate missed while the car was asleep), the **vampire-drain noise floor** (parked SoC drops smaller than this
  are treated as sensor noise), and the **AC/DC power threshold** (raise it if you have a 22 kW AC wallbox so
  its sessions aren't labelled DC). “The defaults suit most users — change these only if you know why.”
- **🔎 Recover missed charges** (Settings → Diagnostics). A one-time scan of your history for charges that
  happened while the car was asleep, *before* automatic detection existed, and were never logged — it **shows
  you what it found before adding anything**, and is safe to re-run (no duplicates).
- **🔋 Battery capacity is now editable** (Settings). Pre-filled per model; edit it if yours differs, or click
  **“use measured”** to adopt the value Mate worked out from your own charges. Changing it never rewrites past
  charges, and your battery-health % keeps measuring against the original spec.
- **🔒 Single “Door Lock” toggle for Home Assistant.** A proper MQTT *lock* entity that shows the locked state
  **and** locks/unlocks in one tap — so it fits as a single dashboard or phone front-screen button. The
  separate Lock/Unlock buttons stay for anyone already using them.

### Changed
- **🔋 Battery capacity defaults are now the usable (net) figures**, not the gross pack — T03 36.0, B10 Pro
  55.0 / Pro Max 65.0, C10 69.9 / 81.9 kWh. Existing installs keep whatever they had configured (nothing is
  silently changed); the new editable field + “use measured” let you fine-tune to your own car.

### Fixed
- **🔄 Command tiles no longer get stuck after a lock / trunk / climate command (#34).** The command worked,
  but the few-seconds-later check read the cloud before the car had reported the new state, decided the command
  “hadn’t taken”, and saved that stale reading — so the tile (and even a page reload) kept showing the old
  state until you tapped again or hit Refresh. Mate now **waits for the car to actually confirm** the change
  (and never saves an unconfirmed reading in the meantime), the tile flips instantly on the first tap, and
  back-to-back commands can’t clobber each other.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **🔋 Battery card on the Charges page.** Charge percentage and range now live right where you watch a
  charge happen — no more flipping back to Overview. The card sits between the live-charging panel and the
  charge limit, refreshes every 30 s while you watch, and its battery bar carries a small **marker at your
  charge-limit position**, so you can see at a glance how far the charge will go. (Overview keeps its own
  card, nothing moved away.)
- **🔄 OTA-update indicator (Overview).** Mate now checks the car's message inbox for a pending vehicle
  software update and shows it on the Overview card — so you know an OTA is waiting without opening the
  official app.
- **⬆️ Mate self-update badge.** Mate checks GitHub (every 6 h, in the background) for a newer release and
  shows a small badge next to the version number when one is available — handy for standalone-Docker users
  who don't get Home Assistant's update prompts.

### Changed
- **🔌 The "Unlock cable" button moved to the Charges page** (inside the Charge-limit card, with a short
  description). It's a charging action, so it now lives with the other charging controls instead of the
  Commands page. Same command, same confirmation prompt — and the Home Assistant / MQTT button is unchanged.

### Fixed
- **🌍 West-of-Greenwich cars were plotted in the sea (#30).** The cloud reports the GPS longitude in two
  signals — one **without its sign**, which is the one Mate read: fine for most of mainland Europe (east of
  Greenwich), but a UK car at 1.9°W was mapped at 1.9°E, in the North Sea. Mate now reads the **signed**
  coordinate pair (with the old ones as fallback). Thanks @BatterBits for capturing the raw signals that
  cracked it — positions recorded before this fix keep the old sign; the map is correct from the first poll
  after updating.
- **⚡ Charge energy was over-stated ~15% on charges ending at 100% — the "107% efficiency".** The car's BMS
  *snaps* the displayed battery % to 100 with zero energy actually delivered in the very moment charging
  stops (a top-of-charge recalibration), inflating the ΔSoC-based energy estimate — which became visible as
  an impossible ">100% efficiency" next to the measured wallbox figure. Verified against the integrated
  charging-power telemetry (the true AC→DC efficiency is ~90%): Mate now anchors the energy of 100%-ending
  charges to the last battery % seen *while still charging*, a **one-time automatic repair** recomputes the
  affected historical charges on first start after updating (costs billed on the wallbox counter are
  untouched; DC-estimated costs are rescaled at your original price), and an impossible efficiency is never
  displayed again. Mid-range charges were verified byte-identical before/after — they were always correct.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **🩺 Diagnostics card (Settings → Diagnostics).** A one-stop place to grab everything we need when
  something goes wrong, so you don't have to dig through container / Home-Assistant add-on logs. It shows a
  read-only system snapshot (Mate version, model, masked VIN, DB size + row counts, last poll, which
  integrations are on), lets you view the recent **poller / web logs** and the car's current **raw signals**
  inline (with a Copy button), and a **Download diagnostics** button that bundles the parts you tick into one
  `.txt` you can attach to a GitHub issue. **Privacy by design:** the downloadable logs always mask your
  personal info — VIN, credentials and e-mail addresses — and never include GPS; the raw-signals view (which
  does include your location) is a separate, explicit action.
- **📏 Units: Metric / Imperial UK / Imperial US** (Settings → Units). Distances, speeds, temperatures and
  tyre pressures now display in your chosen system — **km/°C/bar**, **miles + mph but °C** (the UK), or
  **miles + °F + psi** (the US). It's **display-only**: your stored data always stays metric, so you can
  switch back and forth any time with nothing lost.

### Fixed
- **🔌 Charges missed while the car was asleep are now recorded (#29).** A home charge that started and
  finished while the car was offline/asleep to the cloud was never seen "live" and so was lost entirely.
  Mate now notices the battery-level jump and **reconstructs the charge** from it (marked *auto-detected*),
  instead of dropping it.
- **🛞 Tyre pressures were shown on the wrong wheels (#32).** The wheel order inherited from the upstream
  library was wrong for the B10; corrected (cross-checked on two real cars against the official app), so each
  pressure now matches the right corner.
- **🔄 The Refresh button is now reachable on phones.** On small / portrait screens it was hidden; it now sits
  in the mobile header, always one tap away.

### Changed
- **Doors and seats are now labelled by physical position** (front-left / front-right …) instead of
  driver / passenger. This reads correctly on both left- and right-hand-drive cars (the old labels were
  inverted for RHD/UK vehicles).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **🔗 Manual trip merge.** A journey that a short, non-charging stop split into two (or more) separate
  trips can now be joined back into one. On the Trips page, the **🔗 Merge** toggle draws a connector
  between every pair of adjacent trips that can be joined; a **gap slider** (5–90 min, default 30) widens
  or narrows which pairs qualify, live. A pair is offered only when the second trip starts within the gap
  **and** at no higher SoC than the first one ended — a SoC rise means you charged in between, so those
  (e.g. the legs of a long road trip) are never merged. Clicking a connector shows a preview (combined
  route + distance, energy and *driving-only* duration) before you confirm. It's **fully reversible and
  non-destructive**: a merged trip carries a 🔗 badge and an **Unmerge** button, and splitting it restores
  the originals exactly. Distance/efficiency are recomputed over the whole trip; the stop time is excluded
  from the duration (and shown separately).
- **🔄 Refresh button.** A manual "Refresh" at the top of the sidebar pulls the car's current state from
  the Leapmotor cloud right away instead of waiting for the next poll. Mate still reads **passively** (it
  never wakes the car or drains the battery), so this just skips the wait when the car is already awake; a
  sleeping car keeps its last reported state until it next wakes. The README now spells out that Mate
  isn't real-time — it polls about every 30 s while parked and 10 s while driving.

### Changed
- **Stationary discharge (vampire drain) now catches slow-draining cars.** The detection threshold dropped
  from 0.5 % to **0.2 %** of SoC per parked period, so cars that lose little while parked — and shorter
  stops — now show up too, instead of being filtered out as sensor noise.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Home charge cost is now measured from the wallbox's own energy counter — not estimated.**
  When a wallbox with a kWh counter is paired, Mate samples the counter all through the charge and bills
  the **energy it actually added** — the sum of the counter's increases over the session, i.e. the exact
  AC energy the wallbox delivered (conversion losses included). It's **reset/race-safe**: a per-session
  counter that zeroes mid-charge is handled just like a lifetime total, no matter when it resets relative
  to a poll. The charge card now leads with the **🔌 wallbox (billed)** kWh and shows the **🔋 in-battery
  (DC, from SoC)** energy beneath it with the AC→DC efficiency; the cost is plainly *wallbox kWh × price*.
  With no wallbox counter (or for public charges) the **battery (SoC) energy × price** is billed instead.
  The previous method integrated the fluctuating power curve, which under-counted on short/sparse sessions
  and produced costs that didn't add up — that estimation is gone; instantaneous power now feeds only the
  chart. Day / month / year and lifetime energy totals sum the billed energy too, so cards and totals agree.
  *(Charges recorded before 1.12.0 keep their earlier value and **can't be recomputed** with the new
  method — the wallbox counter readings weren't captured during those past sessions. You can delete an old
  session with its 🗑 button if you prefer.)*

### Added
- **Delete a charge session** — a 🗑 button on each charge card (with confirmation), mirroring the
  existing delete-trip action. Day / month / lifetime totals recompute automatically.
- **Pages keep themselves fresh.** The Charges page reloads the instant a charge finishes, so the new
  completed session shows up without a manual refresh; the live/data pages (Vehicle, Wallbox, Battery,
  Statistics, Trips, Commands) auto-refresh while idle — never while you're filling in a form, and your
  scroll position is kept.

### Fixed
- **A finished charge no longer stays "charging" for several minutes.** On the B10 the car's plug flag
  (signal 47) latches on after an AC charge and clears only minutes later — so a charge session could
  linger open long after charging had finished (and even after the cable was unplugged), inflating its
  window. Mate now derives "plugged in" from the charge-connection signal (1149), which drops as soon as
  the session ends, so the charge closes promptly and its window is accurate.
- **GPX export of a single trip downloaded an empty file.** The download link resolved to the wrong URL
  (a 404) under the app's base path; it's now linked correctly (Home Assistant ingress included).

## [1.11.18] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Vampire drain** on the Battery page — how much charge the car loses while **parked and not charging**.
  Computed automatically from the telemetry Mate already logs: it groups the parked-idle periods (no driving — by
  speed *or* an odometer change — and no charging), measures the SoC each one lost, and shows it as a per-period
  bar plus a "typical %/day" figure. Periods under an hour or with a sub-0.5 % drop are treated as sensor noise.
  No setup, no input.

### Changed
- **Sending a command no longer risks logging you out of the official Leapmotor app** (on a shared account). When a
  command hits an expired token, Mate now **refreshes the token** (keeping the same session) instead of doing a full
  re-login — a full login is what the cloud treats as a new device session and uses to evict your phone. A full
  re-login is still the fallback if the refresh can't recover (and still self-heals a missing certificate). The
  background poller already worked this way; this brings the command path in line.

## [1.11.17] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **A home charge could show an impossible cost** (e.g. 10.3 kWh billed at 11.07 € — GitHub #24). Home charges
  are billed on the real AC energy the wallbox delivers, which is read from the charge's power curve. The 1.11.16
  fix capped the *displayed* charging window and the split-cost query so an offline-interrupted/overlapping charge
  couldn't absorb a later charge's power — but the **power-curve read used for the AC energy was left un-capped**,
  so for such a charge the AC energy (and therefore the cost) still leaked in a later charge's wallbox power. That
  read is now capped at the next charge's start too, so the AC energy and cost stay bounded to the charge itself.
  The same cap was applied to the battery-health energy integral.
- **An implausible wallbox AC reading is no longer shown or billed.** If the AC energy comes out more than twice the
  DC energy into the battery (physically impossible — real efficiency is ~75–95 %), or can't be validated because the
  DC figure is zero/missing, it's discarded and the cost falls back to the battery (DC/SoC) energy. This guards
  against a mis-mapped Home Assistant entity (e.g. a cumulative-kWh meter mapped as the wallbox *power* sensor, which
  showed thousands of kWh at ~0 % efficiency).
- **The AC/DC comparison energy now skips gaps over 15 min**, consistent with the time-of-use cost split, so a long
  pause inside a single charge no longer inflates the AC energy (and the cost billed on it).

> **Note:** a charge's cost is frozen when you confirm its type. To recompute an already-recorded charge with the
> fix, just re-select its location (e.g. "🏠 Home") on the Charges page.

## [1.11.16] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Two charge rows for one plug-in could share the same "Charged HH:MM → HH:MM" end time** (GitHub #23).
  If the cloud API went unreachable mid-charge (3 errors → OFFLINE) and recovered, the poller opened a
  *second* charge row instead of resuming the open one, leaving the first as an orphan. When that orphan was
  later closed, its `ended_at` was set to the latest position — bleeding past the next charge so both rows'
  active-power windows (and split costs) inherited the later charge's last power sample. Fixed at the source
  (the `recorder` no longer opens a charge while one is already open; `close_orphan_charges` caps the orphan's
  end at the next charge's start) **and** defensively in the web layer (the power-window/cost queries are
  capped at the next charge's start, so already-recorded overlaps display and cost correctly too).
- **Time-of-use "split" cost was distorted for a charge with a long pause between two power bursts.** The gap
  between bursts was integrated as a phantom constant-power interval priced at the gap-start's band, skewing
  the weighted-average price. Gaps over 15 min are now skipped (matching the energy-integration guard).
- **A day-restricted off-peak band crossing midnight no longer drops its after-midnight hours to the base
  price.** A "23:30 → 07:30" band on selected days now correctly prices the early-morning hours as belonging
  to the previous (selected) day.

### Changed
- **Re-confirming a charge's type now refreshes its cost immediately** (instead of blanking it until reload)
  and adds a tooltip showing whether the cost was billed on the wallbox **AC** energy or fell back to battery
  **DC** (e.g. when the wallbox AC history is no longer available). The DC fallback is also logged.

## [1.11.15] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Trips were no longer saved on cars that don't report GPS.** The 1.11.10 odometer fix falls back to the
  GPS track for distance; if the car reports neither a valid odometer nor any GPS fixes, the distance came
  out as 0 and the trip was dropped as a "< 0.5 km short hop". Such trips are now **kept** with an unknown
  distance (time, SoC and energy preserved); only genuinely-measured sub-0.5 km hops are dropped. The
  one-time odometer-repair migration is likewise fixed to keep (not delete) GPS-less trips. (Regression in 1.11.10.)
- **Wallbox max-current slider snapping back to 0 after you moved it.** Setting the value re-read the entity
  immediately, but HA's `number.set_value` is async and a device-backed wallbox often still reports the
  old/idle value for a moment, so the slider jumped back. It now keeps the value you set (optimistic), and
  the real reading reappears on the next page load.

### Changed
- **Clearer label for the wallbox power control in Settings.** The wallbox entity-mapping role previously
  labelled "Max current" is now **"Wallbox power control"** (with a hint that it's the adjustable charging
  current/power `number` entity), to make it easier to map the right entity and avoid mistakes.

## [1.11.14] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Home charges are billed on the wallbox's AC energy.** When a wallbox is configured, a **HOME** charge's
  cost now uses the **AC energy the wallbox actually delivered** (what you pay the utility, including AC→DC
  conversion losses) instead of only the DC energy that reached the battery. Public/away charges and setups
  without a wallbox keep DC billing (the only figure available there). Per the "new charges only" rule,
  already-costed charges are unchanged — re-confirm a charge's type to recompute it. Thanks @riri19 (#23).

## [1.11.13] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **"Charged" (actual charging window) showed the wrong start time.** The real charging window added in
  1.11.12 compared the charge timestamps (which arrive in local time) against the UTC position log, so the
  start could be shifted by the timezone offset (e.g. 20:48 instead of 18:48) and the line could even appear
  on normal charges. The window bounds are now normalized to UTC before the lookup. (Regression in 1.11.12.)

## [1.11.12] — 2026-06-08

### Changed
- **Charges show the actual charging window for delayed/scheduled charges.** A session is recorded from
  cable plug-in to unplug, so a scheduled/delayed charge folds in the idle time before/after power
  actually flows. The charges list now adds an **"Charged HH:MM → HH:MM"** line with the real charging
  window (first→last power sample) whenever it differs from the plug-in→unplug window, so the displayed
  times match reality. Normal charges are unchanged, and off-peak (time-of-use) cost was already correct
  in the default "Accurate split" pricing (energy is attributed by the real power curve). Reported in #23.

## [1.11.11] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **One-touch vehicle preparation.** A new **Prepare car** page mirrors the official app's
  "Preparazione del veicolo con un solo tocco": bundle air-conditioning (cool/heat/vent/defrost +
  temperature), front-seat heating/ventilation, steering-wheel heating, mirror heating and an optional
  destination, then run it **now** (cmd 360) or on a **schedule** (cmd 361) with a time + weekdays.
  Scheduled preparations are listed (read from the car), **editable** and individually removable. A
  **"Cancel preparation (all off)"** button turns A/C, seats, steering and mirror heating back off. This
  completes coverage of the B10 app's remote functions in Mate.
- **Delete trip.** The trip detail page now has a **🗑 Delete trip** button (with an explicit
  confirmation prompt) that permanently removes a trip and its GPS track; daily/monthly/lifetime
  totals recompute automatically. Useful for one-off bad data.

## [1.11.10] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Trip distance could log the car's entire mileage.** When the odometer signal was missing on the
  first poll of a trip, the trip's start odometer was recorded as 0 and its distance became the full
  odometer reading — a few-metre move showing up as thousands of km (e.g. a 3-minute hop logged as
  6441 km), inflating daily/monthly totals and efficiency. Trip distance now trusts the odometer delta
  only when both readings are valid, otherwise falling back to the GPS track, which also ignores
  spurious `(0,0)`/out-of-range GPS fixes. Affected trips already in the database are recomputed from
  their GPS track (or removed if under 0.5 km) automatically on the next start — no action needed.
  (Thanks to the user who reported a 6441 km "trip".)

## [1.11.9] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Configurable wallbox detection keywords.** The **Settings → Wallbox** panel now has a field for
  comma-separated keywords used to auto-detect your wallbox entities in Home Assistant. Useful when
  your charger's entities don't match the built-in names (Easee, go-e, KEBA, Pulsar, Feyree…). Leave
  it empty to keep the defaults; custom keywords replace the automatic device-class detection.
  (Thanks to **@hubcasale** — Corrado Gamberoni — PR #22.)

### Fixed
- **Wallbox AC energy / efficiency.** The AC-from-wallbox energy is now integrated with the same
  step-hold resampling used by the comparison chart, so the numeric kWh totals match the chart and no
  longer show impossible efficiency above 100% when Home Assistant logs the wallbox power sparsely.
  (PR #22.)
- Keyword parsing hardened so a delimiter/whitespace-only entry cleanly falls back to the defaults
  instead of disabling detection, and the entity scan reads the setting once instead of per-entity.

## [1.11.8] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Climate pre-conditioning scheduling.** The **Scheduling** page now also writes the **climate
  schedule** (cmd 171) on the B10 — five quick presets (**Quick Cool / Quick Heat / Ventilation /
  Defrost / Auto**), time, days of the week, and (for ventilation / auto) a target temperature on a
  slider; cool/heat lock to their preset temperature. The earlier "the B10 rejects the climate write
  (code -2)" turned out to be a stale/expired `start_time`, not a blocked endpoint — Mate now anchors
  the start to the next occurrence, so the write works. Read / write / edit / cancel all stay in sync
  with the official Leapmotor app. (Reverse-engineered on-car; details shared upstream at
  markoceri/leapmotor-api#5 and kerniger/leapmotor-ha#43.)

### Changed
- **Scheduling UX (charge + climate).** "Active" is now a clear master switch: turning it off resets
  the day selection (the car may charge anytime); the day chips start clean so clicking a day
  *selects* it instead of de-selecting one of seven. Plus an active/inactive badge on both cards, a
  prominent "Mate manages this schedule" note, MDI icons across the page, and an immediate refresh of
  the card after a successful save.

## [1.11.7] — 2026-06-07

### Changed
- **Self-hosted front-end assets (no CDN).** Tailwind, htmx, ApexCharts, Chart.js and Leaflet are now
  served from the add-on itself (`web/static/vendor/`) instead of public CDNs (cdn.tailwindcss.com /
  unpkg / jsdelivr). Benefits: privacy (the UI no longer leaks your IP to third-party CDNs), reliability
  (it keeps working offline or when a CDN is down/blocked), and security (no third-party script in a
  car-control app). No visible change to the interface; verified in both standalone and HA ingress.
  Idea from PR #20 by @LeeTeng2001.

## [1.11.6] — 2026-06-07

### Added
- **Charge scheduling** — a new **Scheduling** page (sidebar). The **charge schedule** (cmd 190) is
  read **and write**: enable, target SoC, start/end window, and a **7-day picker**. Days match the
  Leapmotor app (shown Dom→Sab; stored Monday-first in the `cycles` mask). Writes use read-modify-write
  so the car's existing day mask / repeat / recharge are preserved. (Confirmed on-car.)
  Climate (pre-conditioning) scheduling is **not** included: the B10 cloud rejects the climate-schedule
  write (cmd 171, code -2) even with valid data, so set those in the Leapmotor app for now; we're
  investigating the write path separately.
- **EVCC integration.** The MQTT bridge now also publishes EVCC-friendly `evcc/plugged`, `evcc/charging`
  and `evcc/climate` booleans (`true`/`false`, which EVCC's parser accepts) next to the Home Assistant
  topics — so an EVCC `type: custom` vehicle can read SoC / status / range / odometer. Ready-to-paste
  config in `docs/EVCC.md`.
- **CSV export buttons** on the Trips and Charges pages (links the export that already lived in
  Settings → Export/Backup, plus per-trip GPX).
- **Wallbox — advanced entity mapping** (#21). A **"Show all entities"** toggle in Settings → Wallbox
  lists every sensor/number entity, not just charger-named/typed ones, so foreign-language names or a
  generic energy-meter/relay can be mapped manually. Added FR charger keywords (`borne`, `recharge`,
  `feyree`) to auto-detection (#19).

### Changed
- **Commands page polish.** Uniform tile sizing across all cards; **Quick actions** are now vertical
  tiles with action buttons (Find / Preheat / Unlock cable); stacked columns are equal width on mobile.

## [1.11.5] — 2026-06-07

### Added
- **Unlock charge cable** — unlock the B10 charge port (`unlock_charger`, right 192), promised on #19.
  Exposed both in the **web UI** (new **Quick actions** card, with a confirm prompt) and over **MQTT**
  (Home Assistant discovery button + command handler). i18n in en/it/fr/de.

### Changed
- **Commands page restyle.** A full pass over the page's look & layout:
  - **Icons → Material Design Icons** everywhere, from a single source (`partials/_icons.html` `mdi()`
    macro): automotive glyphs (vehicle lock = `shield-car` green/red, boot = `car-back`, windows =
    `car-side`, roof = `car-convertible`, climate = `air-conditioner`/`snowflake`/`heat-wave`/`fan`/
    `car-defrost-front`, defrost, EV plug, etc.). Card headers and status pills use them too.
  - **Uniform tiles** — fixed icon/label slots + bottom-anchored controls so every tile in a row
    aligns, regardless of label length or control type (slider vs toggle vs button).
  - **Rebalanced two-column layout** — LEFT = Vehicle + Climate, RIGHT = Comfort + Quick actions;
    Comfort widened to 3-up so the columns are height-matched (bottom-left void measured 618px → 72px).
    Collapses to a single column on mobile (vehicle controls first).
  - **Consistent card headers** (icon + title) on every card, including Vehicle.
  - Merged the old Find Car + Battery cards into **Quick actions**; "Preheat" → "Preheat battery".

## [1.11.4] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Full comfort controls on the B10** (thanks @kerniger, leapmotor-ha#41, payloads captured from the app):
  - **Heated & ventilated seats** — a per-seat **level slider (off / 1 / 2 / 3)** for driver & passenger,
    colour-accented (heat = amber, ventilation = sky-blue). Payload `{"position":"driver|copilot","level":"0..3"}`.
  - **Heated steering wheel** and **heated mirrors** — on/off toggles on the Comfort card.
- **More climate controls.** The Climate card adds a **Rapid Ventilation** tile and a **temperature stepper
  (18–32 °C)** that sets the target and starts the climate (auto cool/heat vs the cabin temp). Everything runs
  through the cars' single climate command (cmd 170).
- **READY indicator.** The Overview battery card now shows the car's **READY / Not Ready** state, from the
  faithful B10 signal `bcmKeyPositionOn3` (1258) — driven only by the physical key/READY.
- **Home Assistant (MQTT).** The new comfort & climate commands (seat heat/vent on/off per seat, steering &
  mirror heating, rapid ventilation) are exposed as model-aware buttons over MQTT discovery.

### Changed
- **Tyre pressure — status label per wheel.** Each wheel tile on the Vehicle page now shows a
  colour-coded **status**: *normal* (green), *low* / *high* (amber), *too low* / *too high* (red),
  next to the bar value. Adds **high-pressure** warnings (the view previously only flagged low). Low
  still uses the vehicle's own TPMS warning (plus a < 2.0 bar floor); high is threshold-based
  (> 3.0 bar high, > 3.3 too high). Translated in EN/IT/FR/DE.
- **Colour-coded icons for doors, windows & roof.** On the Vehicle page the tile **icon** (not just the
  text) now carries the state: **closed = green**, **open = sky-blue** (doors, trunk, windows and the
  panoramic roof) — blue reads as "open", not as an alarm.

## [1.11.3] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Working A/C On/Off on the B10.** Turning the climate **fully off** now works on the B10: a new
  **A/C** tile on the Commands → Climate card powers the air-conditioning off (and on). This uses the
  newly-found command (`ac_switch` with `operate=off`, which drives the `acSwitch` signal to 0) —
  discovered by on-car testing. Previously the B10 had no working remote A/C-off and the button was
  hidden; the capability is now re-enabled for the B10 over both the web UI and Home Assistant (MQTT).

### Changed
- **Removed the 1.11.2 "A/C won't fully turn off" notice and the on-press confirmation** — they are
  obsolete now that Mate can fully turn the climate off on the B10.

### Internal
- Reported the B10 A/C-off payload upstream (the library's `ac_off()` sends `operate=close`, which only
  flips the B10 to AUTO; the B10 needs `operate=off`).

## [1.11.2] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Climate "turn off" note.** The Commands page **Climate** card now shows a highlighted notice that
  turning a function off returns the climate to its base mode rather than fully powering the A/C off —
  to switch it off completely you use the Leapmotor app or do it manually in the car. (Reflects the
  cloud API's lack of a reliable remote "A/C off"; avoids confusion that the climate "won't turn off".)
- **Confirmation when turning the climate on.** Pressing a climate **On** button now asks for
  confirmation, reminding you that Mate can't fully power the climate off afterwards (use the Leapmotor
  app or the car). The confirm fires only on the *On* action, not when turning a function off.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Total energy consumed per trip.** The trip detail now shows the trip's total **kWh consumed**
  (next to the efficiency), so you can compare it directly against the regenerated energy. (#18)
- **Per-trip cost.** Each trip now shows its **cost**, computed from the energy consumed × the
  price per kWh of the last charge before the trip. Currency-aware (formatted with the configured
  currency). (#18)

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Comfort sensors on the Commands page.** A new **Comfort** card (beside the controls block)
  shows the read-only state of the **heated/ventilated seats** (driver & passenger), the
  **heated steering wheel** and the **heated mirrors** (left & right) — as tiles matching the
  rest of the page, with proper car icons. These reflect what the car reports. They are also
  published to Home Assistant as native **MQTT sensors**.

### Changed
- **Model-aware controls (per vehicle).** Mate now shows only what *your* car actually supports.
  On the **B10**, for example, the over-MQTT **A/C Off** button is hidden, because the Leapmotor
  cloud does not honour a remote full power-off on that model (an open limitation tracked with the
  API maintainers). CORE telemetry — trips, charges, reports, charts — is never affected.

### Fixed
- **Battery card.** The minimum battery temperature now shows correctly as `NN°` (it previously
  rendered a raw label such as `22min_temp`), and the header texts no longer overlap on narrow
  layouts.

### Docs
- Updated the Home Assistant install instructions for the **2026.2 "Apps" rename** (formerly
  "Add-ons"; *Applicazioni* in Italian).

### Internal
- New per-VIN **capability profile** that drives the model-aware UI/MQTT (each feature classified
  working / broken / untested from on-car probing; confirmed-broken non-core features are hidden).
- CI workflow that auto-syncs the add-on repository's version on each published release.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Collapsible integration cards (Settings).** The ABRP, MQTT and Wallbox cards now tuck
  their configuration fields behind a chevron, so integrations you don't use stay compact
  and the page is easier to scan. The enable toggle and Save button stay visible, and
  ticking the enable box opens the card automatically. Each card's open/collapsed state is
  saved **server-side**, so it's remembered across reloads, reboots and devices — not just
  in the current browser.
- **At-a-glance status badges (Settings).** Each integration card shows a small status dot
  in its header, visible even when the card is collapsed. MQTT does a live broker connect
  (*Connected* / *Not connected*), while ABRP reflects its configuration state (*Active* /
  *Not configured* / *Off*) — the same visual language as the existing Wallbox connection
  badge.

### Changed
- **Upgraded the Leapmotor API library to 0.3.1** (from 0.1.4). This brings native
  handling of the T03 status format and the B10→C10 status-path mapping, so Mate no
  longer needs its own patches for those. The vehicle-data parsing is unchanged
  (raw-signal based), so trips, charges and the dashboard are unaffected.

### Internal
- Dropped the bundled `_get_vehicle_raw_status` monkey-patch (the library now maps the
  B10/B11 status path natively) and replaced the hand-rolled last-week energy and
  consumption-rank endpoints with the library's native methods.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Battery health page.** A new *Battery health* page estimates your pack's usable
  capacity (and a state-of-health %) over time. For each charge it integrates the
  **measured** energy delivered (∫ voltage × current, the same source as the charge
  power curve) and divides it by the SoC gained — so the estimate tracks real battery
  ageing rather than just echoing the configured nominal capacity. Only charges with a
  meaningful SoC rise and stored telemetry are used; the headline figure is smoothed
  over the most recent charges to cut single-session noise. It's an estimate, not a lab
  measurement.
- **Global map.** A new *Map* page draws every trip as a connected route line (white
  casing + blue line so it stays readable over any road colour) — showing everywhere the
  car has driven — plus your **most-visited places** as bubbles sized by visit count
  (start/end points clustered to ~110 m, no reverse geocoding).
- **SoC & speed profile on each trip.** The trip detail page now charts state-of-charge
  and speed over the course of the drive (replacing the plain speed bar).

### Fixed
- **T03 (EU) vehicles now report live data.** The European API returns the live status
  as named fields at the top level instead of the numeric `signal` block used by
  C10/B10, so the poller saw *"no live data"* forever. Mate now parses both shapes. This
  was the real root cause on the T03 in #9 (the shared-car `carId` retry added in 1.8.2
  was unrelated).

### Notes
- Both new pages read **existing data** (the charge telemetry and trip GPS already
  logged) — nothing new is collected. Very old sessions whose GPS samples were pruned
  simply won't appear.

## [1.8.2] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Encrypted credentials at rest.** Your Leapmotor password/PIN and the other stored
  secrets (Home Assistant, ABRP, MQTT and geocoder tokens) are now encrypted in the
  local database with a per‑install key (`/data/secret.key`, auto‑generated; or set
  your own via the `MATE_SECRET_KEY` env var). Existing installs migrate transparently
  on the next start — no re‑login needed. Keep `secret.key` with your backups: a
  database restored without it will ask you to re‑enter the credentials.
- **Optional database pruning** (Settings → Database). Cap raw GPS‑sample storage to
  6/12/18/24 months; the poller prunes old non‑charging samples daily and reclaims
  space — trips and charge curves are always kept. Off by default. The page also shows
  the current database size.
- **Health endpoint** `GET /healthz` (+ Docker HEALTHCHECK): reports whether the poll
  loop is alive, so a wedged poller is visible instead of data silently stopping.
- **Data export & backup.** Settings → Export: download Trips and Charges as CSV and a
  full database backup; each trip page now has a GPX download of its GPS track.

### Changed
- **Faster charge/Wallbox history at scale.** Added a partial index on the telemetry
  table so the charge‑power, time‑of‑use cost and Wallbox queries stay fast as the
  database grows over the years.

### Fixed
- **Shared cars never reported live data** (the poller was stuck on *"Vehicle returned
  no live data"* forever, even while driving). When a car is *shared* to the account —
  exactly what happens if you follow the "use a different account than your phone"
  advice and share the car to that second account — the Leapmotor cloud returns an
  empty status unless the request also carries `carId`. The poller (and the web command
  client) now retry the status request with `carId` when a shared car comes back empty,
  recovering live data automatically. The login line also logs `shared: true/false` to
  make this diagnosable. Reported on the T03 in #9.
- **Regen energy** now scales with the configured driving poll interval instead of a
  hardcoded 10 s.
- **Trip efficiency** is no longer stored as a negative kWh/100km when the battery SOC
  rose over a trip (regen / a cloud SOC blip) — it's withheld instead.

### Security & hardening
- **Secrets are no longer rendered back into the Settings page.** The ABRP / MQTT /
  geocoder fields now show a masked placeholder when set (like the HA token already
  did) and are only overwritten on a non‑empty submit.
- **MQTT commands are thread‑safe.** Remote MQTT commands run on a background thread;
  API access is now serialized with the poll loop and the post‑command "boost" write
  uses its own DB connection, avoiding a rare race.
- **Clear warning on a wrong/missing encryption key** at startup (e.g. a database
  restored without its `secret.key`), instead of an obscure later login failure.
- Added a `.dockerignore` so the local database, `secret.key`, backups and caches can
  never be baked into a built image.
- **Optional login for standalone** (set `MATE_AUTH_PASSWORD`): a password gate with a
  signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=strict session cookie. Off by default and ignored when
  running as a Home Assistant add-on (ingress already authenticates). When enabled it
  also closes the previously open re-`POST /setup` path.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Climate over MQTT is now four buttons** — *Quick Cool*, *Quick Heat*, *Defrost*
  and *A/C Off* — mirroring the in-app Commands page, instead of a single on/off
  switch. The old switch only ran the ventilation fan and its OFF did nothing; the
  buttons send the real climate commands. Turning the A/C fully **off** is
  best-effort — the vehicle cloud doesn't reliably honour it (an open issue with the
  Leapmotor API). The deprecated switch is removed from Home Assistant automatically;
  the read-only *Climate* state sensor stays. (Reported in #14.)
- **Malaysian Ringgit (MYR)** added to the display currencies. (Requested in #13.)

### Fixed
- **Recent Trips on the Overview showed UTC** while the Trips page showed local time.
  The Overview now converts trip times to your local timezone too. (#12)

### Changed
- **Quieter logs when the car is asleep.** A parked car in deep sleep is normal; the
  back-off is now logged once instead of repeating every cycle with a climbing
  "after N tries" count that read like an escalating failure.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Customizable display currency.** The euro is no longer hardcoded — pick your
  currency from **30 world currencies** (€, $, £, CHF, kr, zł, Ft, ¥, …) in
  **Settings → Language & Currency**. Every cost across the app (Overview, Charges,
  Wallbox, totals) reformats to it, with the correct **symbol placement**
  (e.g. `$12.50` vs `12,50 €`) and **decimal digits** per currency (2 for most,
  0 for yen/forint/won). The number format (decimal/thousands separator) follows
  the selected UI language. The Settings *Language* card is now *Language &
  Currency*, listing currencies by name (e.g. "Euro (€) — EUR"). (Requested in #10.)

## [1.7.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Scary `Poll error: 'signal'` when the car is asleep.** When the Leapmotor cloud
  returned a status without the live signal block — the car in deep sleep / briefly
  not reporting, or a transient cloud hiccup — the poller raised a bare `KeyError`
  and logged it as an `ERROR`, which looked like a crash. It's now handled cleanly:
  the poller logs a clear "vehicle not reporting (asleep/unavailable)" message,
  retries a couple of times, then backs off — and recovers on its own once the car
  reports again. (#9)

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Charge Prices page with time-of-use tariffs.** A dedicated *Charge Prices*
  page replaces the single price field in Settings. Choose **flat (24h)** pricing
  or **time-of-use bands**: add one or more time windows, pick which **days of the
  week** each applies to (with All / Weekdays / Weekend shortcuts), and set a price
  per **charge type** (Home/AC/DC/HPC) for each. Leave a cell blank to use the base
  price, or enter `0` for free. Each session's cost is computed by splitting its
  energy across the bands it spans using the real power curve. Cost changes apply to
  **new charges only** — a charge's cost is frozen when you confirm its type, so
  later price/band edits never alter past sessions. (Requested in #7.)
- **MQTT "Test connection" button** (Settings → MQTT) — check the
  broker/port/credentials/TLS before saving.

### Fixed
- **MQTT state out of sync after a command.** Lock/unlock/trunk/climate commands
  sent over MQTT executed, but the published state only refreshed on the next poll
  (up to 30 s when parked), so Home Assistant showed stale values. Mate now
  publishes the expected state immediately and triggers a fast re-poll to confirm —
  the same approach the web UI already uses.
- **Inverted lock state in Home Assistant.** A locked car showed up as "Unlocked"
  (Home Assistant's `lock` binary-sensor class is inverted). The lock entity now
  displays correctly; the published topic value is unchanged.

### Changed
- **MQTT topic prefix now scopes the Home Assistant device.** You can run a second
  instance (e.g. a test poller alongside the production add-on, same car) on a
  different prefix without it overwriting the same entities. The default prefix is
  unchanged, so existing installs are unaffected.

## [1.6.3] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Vehicle page redesigned with Material Design icons.** Doors, trunk, windows,
  panoramic roof, tyres and temperatures now use clear, car-specific icons instead
  of emoji (windows even switch between open/closed icons). Self-contained inline
  SVGs — no external icon font.

### Fixed
- **Panoramic roof shows its real state.** The Vehicle page now reads the roof
  position live from the car (signal 1724), consistent with the Commands page,
  instead of relying on the last command / showing "no data".
- **Version number is now visible on mobile** (in the top bar), not only on desktop.

## [1.6.2] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Wrong clock times for users outside Italy.** The add-on fell back to a
  hardcoded `Europe/Rome` timezone when `TZ` wasn't in the environment (the
  Supervisor only sets the container's local time). Now the UI uses the system /
  Home Assistant timezone, so trips, charges and "last seen" show your real local
  time everywhere.
- **Overview "State" now follows the gear, not just speed.** A stop in traffic
  with the car in Drive used to read as "Parked"; now any gear other than P shows
  "Driving".

### Changed
- **Panoramic roof** shows "Operate first" instead of "No data" when its position
  is unknown — the B10 doesn't report the sunblind's position, so Mate only knows
  it after you open/close it from the app.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Poller regression (since 1.5.1).** The configurable charge-detection setting
  was applied with a wrong call that raised an error on every poll cycle, so the
  poller stopped collecting data. Fixed — polling, trip and charge detection work
  again. **Update strongly recommended if you're on 1.5.1 or 1.6.0.**
- **Setup PIN field said "6-digit".** The Leapmotor operation PIN is **4 digits** —
  the placeholder/hint and the input length now say 4.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Responsive layout for phones and tablets.** On small screens the sidebar
  becomes a slide-out drawer with a top bar + hamburger menu, the content reflows
  to full width, and the maps no longer overlap the navigation. The desktop layout
  is unchanged. Contributed by **@hubcasale** (#6) — thank you!

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Configurable charge-detection threshold.** The minimum charging current that
  counts as "charging" (below it a plugged-in car is treated as idle) is now
  adjustable in **Settings → Charge detection** (0.5–16 A, default 2 A). Useful for
  low-power / experimental supplies. The poller applies it live, no restart needed.
  Thanks @hubcasale for the suggestion.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Navigation page 🧭 — send a destination to the car.** Type a street + city,
  preview it on the map, and push it straight to the vehicle's built-in navigation
  (no PIN). The page also shows the car's **current address** (reverse-geocoded from
  its GPS). Fully translated (EN/IT/FR/DE).
- **Configurable geocoder.** Address lookup works out of the box with a free
  OpenStreetMap-based provider (no key). For better street/house-number coverage you
  can optionally pick a provider and paste an API key in **Settings → Address lookup**
  — **Geoapify** (recommended, free, no credit card, includes house numbers),
  **LocationIQ** or **TomTom**. Any provider error falls back to the keyless lookup.
- **"Free" charge type.** Mark a session as free charging (🆓) — its cost is recorded
  as €0.00.

### Changed
- **Charge-type labels are now language-neutral** — 🏠 Home · 🔌 AC · ⚡ DC · 🚀 HPC ·
  🆓 FREE — so they read the same in every UI language.

### Fixed
- **The "charges to confirm" banner no longer sticks while a charge is in progress.**
  An ongoing session can't be confirmed yet, so it's excluded from the count; only
  finished, unconfirmed charges are flagged.
- **Wallbox power/energy units are auto-detected.** Wallboxes that report power in
  **watts** (or energy in **Wh**) are now normalised to kW/kWh everywhere — the
  AC-vs-DC comparison and the per-session power chart, not just the live panel.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **German (Deutsch) UI language.** Full translation of the web interface — nav,
  Overview, Trips, Charges, Statistics, Commands, Vehicle, Wallbox, Settings and the
  first-run Setup wizard. Selectable from Settings and the setup screen, and
  auto-detected from the browser language. Requested by the community on GitHub.

### Fixed
- **Month names in the history trees are now localized.** The year → month → day
  breakdowns on the Trips, Charges, Statistics and Wallbox-comparison pages built
  their labels with `strftime("%B"/"%b")`, which is always English regardless of the
  selected language. Month names (full and abbreviated) are now translated for all
  languages (it/fr/de/en) without relying on system locales.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Tyre pressures were shown on the wrong wheels.** The B10 signal→wheel mapping is
  corrected per markoceri/leapmotor-api's documented signal table — the pressure and
  its low-pressure alarm now refer to the same (correct) wheel.
- **Removed the bogus "outside temperature".** That signal (2101) is actually the
  driver-seat ventilation level; no ambient-temperature signal exists, so the value
  was meaningless. Dropped from the Vehicle page, the MQTT sensors and ABRP
  telemetry (battery/cabin/AC-target temperatures were already correct).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Lower the charge-detection current threshold from 3.0 A to 2.0 A so low-power
  home charges (and the tail end of a charge) are still detected as charging. The
  regen detection threshold is separate and unaffected.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **ABRP (A Better Route Planner) live telemetry** — optional. Enable it and paste
  your personal ABRP token in Settings, and the car's live data (SOC, position,
  speed, power, temperatures…) is forwarded to ABRP for live route planning. Off
  by default; nothing is sent without a token.
- **MQTT → Home Assistant bridge** — optional. Configure a broker in Settings and
  the car is published to Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery as native entities:
  sensors (SOC, range, individual tyres, temperatures, charge…), binary sensors
  (doors/windows/lock/charging), a GPS tracker, command buttons (lock/unlock,
  trunk, find car) and a climate switch. TLS supported. Off by default.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Charge type confirmation.** A new charge is no longer silently assumed to be
  "Home": until you set its type it shows a "To confirm" badge (with a "What type
  of charge?" prompt), and the Charges page shows how many are still pending. A
  charge enters the wallbox comparison only once you confirm it as Home.

### Changed
- **The wallbox comparison is now scoped to Home charges**, so it stays correct
  with multiple EVs sharing one wallbox and with public/away charging. History,
  totals and the per‑charge overlay only consider Home charges (a wallbox charges
  one car at a time, so a Home session means this car was on the wallbox);
  public/away and unconfirmed charges are excluded.
- The wallbox **live panel** now shows session metrics only while the car is
  plugged in — otherwise the live reading could be another vehicle on the same
  wallbox. Session cost and max available power are always shown.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- **Wallbox in add‑on mode** — the add‑on now correctly detects the Home Assistant
  Supervisor token. On the s6‑overlay base images the Supervisor‑provided
  environment (including `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`) isn't passed to the service process,
  so the add‑on fell back to the standalone URL+token form and showed "not
  connected". `run.sh` now loads it from the s6 container environment, and logs
  whether the HA API is available at startup.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Wallbox integration (Home Assistant)** — optional. Pair a wallbox already in
  Home Assistant to get a dedicated **Wallbox** page with: a live panel (power,
  status, session energy, charging speed, max available power) plus the session
  cost; a control to set the wallbox max charging current; and an **AC‑vs‑DC
  comparison** per charge session — kWh delivered by the wallbox vs kWh into the
  battery, with charging efficiency — as a year/month/day history with an
  expandable power chart. Connects automatically via the Supervisor API when run
  as an add‑on (any external access mode — HTTP, HTTPS, Nabu Casa), or via an HA
  URL + a Long‑Lived Access Token when standalone (self‑signed HTTPS is fine).
  Enable and configure it in **Settings → Wallbox present** (live connection
  status + an entity picker limited to your wallbox's own sensors).

### Changed
- **Trips page redesign** — trip rows show a remaining/used SOC bar, a coloured
  efficiency pill and a route thumbnail; the dashboard gained four summary tiles
  (total distance, trips, average efficiency, regen). Trip distance now comes from
  the odometer delta (more accurate than GPS).
- **Vehicle page** restyled to match the rest of the app (slate cards/tiles).
- **Settings** reorganised into three columns; the Wallbox card stays minimal when
  disabled and reveals the HA connection + an expandable sensor list when enabled.
- Quantities across the UI are shown to at most two decimals, at full precision
  (no over‑rounding).

## [1.0.8] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Charging-power chart** in the Charges page. Each session has an expandable
  "Charging power" section that lazy-loads an inline chart of power over time
  (with SOC on a second axis). Power is the same value as the official
  charging-power reading (battery voltage × current) and is kept at full
  precision so the real curve is visible — most useful on DC fast charging.

### Changed
- **Settings layout**: cards now use a masonry column layout, removing the empty
  gap that appeared under shorter cards (e.g. Language) next to taller ones.

## [1.0.7] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Language selector in Settings**. The language could previously only be chosen
  in the initial setup wizard, so already-installed users had no way to switch.
  Settings now has a language dropdown (🇬🇧 English / 🇮🇹 Italiano / 🇫🇷 Français);
  changing it saves immediately and reloads the page in the new language.

## [1.0.6] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **French language** (🇫🇷). The setup wizard now offers three languages — English,
  Italian and French — with three flag buttons and auto-detection of French
  browsers. The whole app is translated: overview, trips, charges, commands,
  statistics, the vehicle page, and both wizard steps (certificate + account login).

### Fixed
- Two certificate-step labels (`app.crt`, `app.key`) were hard-coded in English
  regardless of the chosen language; they are now translated (this also fixes
  Italian, where they were previously shown in English too).

## [1.0.5] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Poller self-recovery**: if the account TLS certificate temp file vanished from
  `/tmp` (every poll then failed with "Could not find the TLS certificate file"),
  the poller stayed stuck in an error loop indefinitely. It now forces a fresh
  login to re-create the certificate on cert/auth/token/connection errors (rate-
  limited to ~once per minute). Also recovers from auth/token drops.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Local time in the UI**: trip/charge times were shown in UTC; they are now
  converted to the local timezone (`TZ`, which Home Assistant passes to add-ons
  automatically; standalone Docker sets `TZ` in compose). Added `tzdata`.
- **Trip fragmentation**: a drive was split into many records because a trip ended
  after just ~20s of zero speed. Trip detection is now gear-based and matches the
  HA reference: a trip ends only when gear **P** is held ~1 min (red lights / brief
  stops in gear D no longer split it), and movements **< 0.5 km** are discarded.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Statistics**: the "Consumption trend (6 weeks)" chart legend showed week
  dates as `MM-DD` (US-style); they are now formatted as `DD/MM`.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Vehicle page**: new sidebar page with live tyre pressure (per corner, with
  low-pressure alarms), door and window open/closed states, panoramic roof and
  battery/cabin temperatures — styled as gradient status cards.

### Fixed
- `find_car` was calling a non-existent client method; now driven through the
  registered remote action so it reaches the car.
- Install docs spell out the exact add-on repository URL.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Home Assistant ingress support**: the web UI now works inside the add-on
  panel. URLs are resolved against the ingress path via `<base href>` (from the
  `X-Ingress-Path` header) and all template/JS URLs are relative; server
  redirects carry the ingress prefix. Standalone is unaffected.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-01

First public release.

### Added
- Trip tracking with route map, distance, energy, efficiency and regen.
- Charge logging with AC/DC detection, energy added, power and distribution chart.
- Statistics: driving/AC/other energy split and a 6-week consumption trend (Leapmotor cloud).
- Remote control: lock, windows, trunk, panoramic roof, climate, find car, battery preheat.
- Two-step setup wizard: app certificate (upload/paste) + account login with EU model/battery auto-detect.
- Configurable polling (parked/driving), bilingual UI (EN/IT).
- Home Assistant add-on and standalone Docker deployment.
